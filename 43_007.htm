<blockquote>
7:1 And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him.<br>
<br>
7:2 Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.<br>
<br>
7:3 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.<br>
<br>
7:4 For no man doeth anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.<br>
<br>
7:5 For even his brethren did not believe on him.<br>
<br>
7:6 Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.<br>
<br>
7:7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.<br>
<br>
7:8 Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.<br>
<br>
7:9 And having said these things unto them, he abode `still' in Galilee.<br>
<br>
7:10 But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.<br>
<br>
7:11 The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?<br>
<br>
7:12 And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray.<br>
<br>
7:13 Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.<br>
<br>
7:14 But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.<br>
<br>
7:15 The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?<br>
<br>
7:16 Jesus therefore answered them and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.<br>
<br>
7:17 If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or `whether' I speak from myself.<br>
<br>
7:18 He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.<br>
<br>
7:19 Did not Moses give you the law, and `yet' none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me?<br>
<br>
7:20 The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?<br>
<br>
7:21 Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof.<br>
<br>
7:22 Moses hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.<br>
<br>
7:23 If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?<br>
<br>
7:24 Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.<br>
<br>
7:25 Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?<br>
<br>
7:26 And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?<br>
<br>
7:27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.<br>
<br>
7:28 Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.<br>
<br>
7:29 I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.<br>
<br>
7:30 They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.<br>
<br>
7:31 But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done?<br>
<br>
7:32 The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.<br>
<br>
7:33 Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.<br>
<br>
7:34 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.<br>
<br>
7:35 The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?<br>
<br>
7:36 What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?<br>
<br>
7:37 Now on the last day, the great `day' of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.<br>
<br>
7:38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.<br>
<br>
7:39 But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet `given'; because Jesus was not yet glorified.<br>
<br>
7:40 `Some' of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.<br>
<br>
7:41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?<br>
<br>
7:42 Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?<br>
<br>
7:43 So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.<br>
<br>
7:44 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.<br>
<br>
7:45 The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him?<br>
<br>
7:46 The officers answered, Never man so spake.<br>
<br>
7:47 The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray?<br>
<br>
7:48 Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?<br>
<br>
7:49 But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed.<br>
<br>
7:50 Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them),<br>
<br>
7:51 Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?<br>
<br>
7:52 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.<br>
<br>
7:53 And they went every man unto his own house:<br>
<br>
