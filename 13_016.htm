<blockquote>
16:1 And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.<br>
<br>
16:2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.<br>
<br>
16:3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion `of flesh', and a cake of raisins.<br>
<br>
16:4 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Jehovah, the God of Israel:<br>
<br>
16:5 Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;<br>
<br>
16:6 and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.<br>
<br>
16:7 Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto Jehovah, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.<br>
<br>
16:8 O give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known his doings among the peoples.<br>
<br>
16:9 Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvellous works.<br>
<br>
16:10 Glory ye in his holy name; Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.<br>
<br>
16:11 Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore.<br>
<br>
16:12 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,<br>
<br>
16:13 O ye seed of Israel his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.<br>
<br>
16:14 He is Jehovah our God; His judgments are in all the earth.<br>
<br>
16:15 Remember his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,<br>
<br>
16:16 `The covenant' which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,<br>
<br>
16:17 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,<br>
<br>
16:18 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;<br>
<br>
16:19 When ye were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it;<br>
<br>
16:20 And they went about from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people.<br>
<br>
16:21 He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,<br>
<br>
16:22 `Saying', Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.<br>
<br>
16:23 Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; Show forth his salvation from day to day.<br>
<br>
16:24 Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples.<br>
<br>
16:25 For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He also is to be feared above all gods.<br>
<br>
16:26 For all the gods of the peoples are idols: But Jehovah made the heavens.<br>
<br>
16:27 Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and gladness are in his place.<br>
<br>
16:28 Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength;<br>
<br>
16:29 Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come before him: Worship Jehovah in holy array.<br>
<br>
16:30 Tremble before him, all the earth: The world also is established that it cannot be moved.<br>
<br>
16:31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth.<br>
<br>
16:32 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein;<br>
<br>
16:33 Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before Jehovah; For he cometh to judge the earth.<br>
<br>
16:34 O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness `endureth' for ever.<br>
<br>
16:35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us together and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.<br>
<br>
16:36 Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised Jehovah.<br>
<br>
16:37 So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day's work required;<br>
<br>
16:38 and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;<br>
<br>
16:39 and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon,<br>
<br>
16:40 to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded unto Israel;<br>
<br>
16:41 and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, because his lovingkindness `endureth' for ever;<br>
<br>
16:42 and with them Heman and Jeduthun `with' trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and `with' instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.<br>
<br>
16:43 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.<br>
