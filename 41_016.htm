<blockquote>
16:1 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the `mother' of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.<br>
<br>
16:2 And very early on the first day of the week, they come to the tomb when the sun was risen.<br>
<br>
16:3 And they were saying among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb?<br>
<br>
16:4 and looking up, they see that the stone is rolled back: for it was exceeding great.<br>
<br>
16:5 And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe; and they were amazed.<br>
<br>
16:6 And he saith unto them, Be not amazed: ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who hath been crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold, the place where they laid him!<br>
<br>
16:7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.<br>
<br>
16:8 And they went out, and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them: and they said nothing to any one; for they were afraid.<br>
<br>
16:9 Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.<br>
<br>
16:10 She went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.<br>
<br>
16:11 And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, disbelieved.<br>
<br>
16:12 And after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.<br>
<br>
16:13 And they went away and told it unto the rest: neither believed they them.<br>
<br>
16:14 And afterward he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat; and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them that had seen him after he was risen.<br>
<br>
16:15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation.<br>
<br>
16:16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned.<br>
<br>
16:17 And these signs shall accompany them that believe: in my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;<br>
<br>
16:18 they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.<br>
<br>
16:19 So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken unto them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.<br>
<br>
16:20 And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.<br>
<br>
