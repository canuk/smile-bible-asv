<blockquote>
4:1 And again he began to teach by the sea side. And there is gathered unto him a very great multitude, so that he entered into a boat, and sat in the sea; and all the multitude were by the sea on the land.<br>
<br>
4:2 And he taught them many things in parables, and said unto them in his teaching,<br>
<br>
4:3 Hearken: Behold, the sower went forth to sow:<br>
<br>
4:4 and it came to pass, as he sowed, some `seed' fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured it.<br>
<br>
4:5 And other fell on the rocky `ground', where it had not much earth; and straightway it sprang up, because it had no deepness of earth:<br>
<br>
4:6 and when the sun was risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.<br>
<br>
4:7 And other fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.<br>
<br>
4:8 And others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing; and brought forth, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.<br>
<br>
4:9 And he said, Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.<br>
<br>
4:10 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parables.<br>
<br>
4:11 And he said unto them, Unto you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all things are done in parables:<br>
<br>
4:12 that seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest haply they should turn again, and it should be forgiven them.<br>
<br>
4:13 And he saith unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how shall ye know all the parables?<br>
<br>
4:14 The sower soweth the word.<br>
<br>
4:15 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, straightway cometh Satan, and taketh away the word which hath been sown in them.<br>
<br>
4:16 And these in like manner are they that are sown upon the rocky `places', who, when they have heard the word, straightway receive it with joy;<br>
<br>
4:17 and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway they stumble.<br>
<br>
4:18 And others are they that are sown among the thorns; these are they that have heard the word,<br>
<br>
4:19 and the cares of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it becometh unfruitful.<br>
<br>
4:20 And those are they that were sown upon the good ground; such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, thirtyfold, and sixtyfold, and a hundredfold.<br>
<br>
4:21 And he said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel, or under the bed, `and' not to be put on the stand?<br>
<br>
4:22 For there is nothing hid, save that it should be manifested; neither was `anything' made secret, but that it should come to light.<br>
<br>
4:23 If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.<br>
<br>
4:24 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you; and more shall be given unto you.<br>
<br>
4:25 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.<br>
<br>
4:26 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;<br>
<br>
4:27 and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he knoweth not how.<br>
<br>
4:28 The earth beareth fruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.<br>
<br>
4:29 But when the fruit is ripe, straightway he putteth forth the sickle, because the harvest is come.<br>
<br>
4:30 And he said, How shall we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable shall we set it forth?<br>
<br>
4:31 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown upon the earth, though it be less than all the seeds that are upon the earth,<br>
<br>
4:32 yet when it is sown, groweth up, and becometh greater than all the herbs, and putteth out great branches; so that the birds of the heaven can lodge under the shadow thereof.<br>
<br>
4:33 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they were able to hear it;<br>
<br>
4:34 and without a parable spake he not unto them: but privately to his own disciples he expounded all things.<br>
<br>
4:35 And on that day, when even was come, he saith unto them, Let us go over unto the other side.<br>
<br>
4:36 And leaving the multitude, they take him with them, even as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.<br>
<br>
4:37 And there ariseth a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the boat, insomuch that the boat was now filling.<br>
<br>
4:38 And he himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion: and they awake him, and say unto him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?<br>
<br>
4:39 And he awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.<br>
<br>
4:40 And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful? have ye not yet faith?<br>
<br>
4:41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?<br>
