<blockquote>
15:1 Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.<br>
<br>
15:2 Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying.<br>
<br>
15:3 For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.<br>
<br>
15:4 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.<br>
<br>
15:5 Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:<br>
<br>
15:6 that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
15:7 Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.<br>
<br>
15:8 For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises `given' unto the fathers,<br>
<br>
15:9 and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, And sing unto thy name.<br>
<br>
15:10 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.<br>
<br>
15:11 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; And let all the peoples praise him.<br>
<br>
15:12 And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; On him shall the Gentiles hope.<br>
<br>
15:13 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
15:14 And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.<br>
<br>
15:15 But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God,<br>
<br>
15:16 that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
15:17 I have therefore my glorifying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.<br>
<br>
15:18 For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,<br>
<br>
15:19 in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Spirit; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;<br>
<br>
15:20 yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was `already' named, that I might not build upon another man's foundation;<br>
<br>
15:21 but, as it is written, They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came, And they who have not heard shall understand.<br>
<br>
15:22 Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:<br>
<br>
15:23 but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you,<br>
<br>
15:24 whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)--<br>
<br>
15:25 but now, I `say', I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.<br>
<br>
15:26 For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
15:27 Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it `to them' also to minister unto them in carnal things.<br>
<br>
15:28 When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.<br>
<br>
15:29 And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.<br>
<br>
15:30 Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;<br>
<br>
15:31 that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea, and `that' my ministration which `I have' for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;<br>
<br>
15:32 that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.<br>
<br>
15:33 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.<br>
<br>
