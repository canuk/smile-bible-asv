<blockquote>
10:1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.<br>
<br>
10:2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.<br>
<br>
10:3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.<br>
<br>
10:4 When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.<br>
<br>
10:5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.<br>
<br>
10:6 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.<br>
<br>
10:7 Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.<br>
<br>
10:8 All that came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.<br>
<br>
10:9 I am the door; by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture.<br>
<br>
10:10 The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may have `it' abundantly.<br>
<br>
10:11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.<br>
<br>
10:12 He that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth `them':<br>
<br>
10:13 `he fleeth' because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep.<br>
<br>
10:14 I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me,<br>
<br>
10:15 even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.<br>
<br>
10:16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice: and they shall become one flock, one shepherd.<br>
<br>
10:17 Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.<br>
<br>
10:18 No one taketh it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.<br>
<br>
10:19 There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words.<br>
<br>
10:20 And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is mad; why hear ye him?<br>
<br>
10:21 Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?<br>
<br>
10:22 And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem:<br>
<br>
10:23 it was winter; and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon's porch.<br>
<br>
10:24 The Jews therefore came round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.<br>
<br>
10:25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father's name, these bear witness of me.<br>
<br>
10:26 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.<br>
<br>
10:27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:<br>
<br>
10:28 and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.<br>
<br>
10:29 My Father, who hath given `them' unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch `them' out of the Father's hand.<br>
<br>
10:30 I and the Father are one.<br>
<br>
10:31 The Jews took up stones again to stone him.<br>
<br>
10:32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?<br>
<br>
10:33 The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.<br>
<br>
10:34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, ye are gods?<br>
<br>
10:35 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),<br>
<br>
10:36 say ye of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am `the' Son of God?<br>
<br>
10:37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.<br>
<br>
10:38 But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.<br>
<br>
10:39 They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.<br>
<br>
10:40 And he went away again beyond the Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there be abode.<br>
<br>
10:41 And many came unto him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true.<br>
<br>
10:42 And many believed on him there.<br>
