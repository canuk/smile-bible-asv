<blockquote>
2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.<br>
<br>
2:2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.<br>
<br>
2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid it in the flags by the river's brink.<br>
<br>
2:4 And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.<br>
<br>
2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river-side; and she saw the ark among the flags, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.<br>
<br>
2:6 And she opened it, and saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.<br>
<br>
2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?<br>
<br>
2:8 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child's mother.<br>
<br>
2:9 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.<br>
<br>
2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.<br>
<br>
2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.<br>
<br>
2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.<br>
<br>
2:13 And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?<br>
<br>
2:14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.<br>
<br>
2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.<br>
<br>
2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.<br>
<br>
2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.<br>
<br>
2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to-day?<br>
<br>
2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.<br>
<br>
2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.<br>
<br>
2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.<br>
<br>
2:22 And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.<br>
<br>
2:23 And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.<br>
<br>
2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.<br>
<br>
2:25 And God saw the children of Israel, and God took knowledge `of them'.<br>
