<blockquote>
6:1 Flee for safety, ye children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looketh forth from the north, and a great destruction.<br>
<br>
6:2 The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.<br>
<br>
6:3 Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.<br>
<br>
6:4 Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day declineth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.<br>
<br>
6:5 Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.<br>
<br>
6:6 For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.<br>
<br>
6:7 As a well casteth forth its waters, so she casteth forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.<br>
<br>
6:8 Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.<br>
<br>
6:9 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.<br>
<br>
6:10 To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.<br>
<br>
6:11 Therefore I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.<br>
<br>
6:12 And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah.<br>
<br>
6:13 For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.<br>
<br>
6:14 They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.<br>
<br>
6:15 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.<br>
<br>
6:16 Thus saith Jehovah, Stand ye in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We will not walk `therein'.<br>
<br>
6:17 And I set watchmen over you, `saying', Hearken to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not hearken.<br>
<br>
6:18 Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.<br>
<br>
6:19 Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.<br>
<br>
6:20 To what purpose cometh there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me.<br>
<br>
6:21 Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.<br>
<br>
6:22 Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a people cometh from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.<br>
<br>
6:23 They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion.<br>
<br>
6:24 We have heard the report thereof; our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, `and' pangs as of a woman in travail.<br>
<br>
6:25 Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, `and' terror, are on every side.<br>
<br>
6:26 O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.<br>
<br>
6:27 I have made thee a trier `and' a fortress among my people; that thou mayest know and try their way.<br>
<br>
6:28 They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.<br>
<br>
6:29 The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.<br>
<br>
6:30 Refuse silver shall men them, because Jehovah hath rejected them.<br>
<br>
