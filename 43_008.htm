<blockquote>
8:1 but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.<br>
<br>
8:2 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.<br>
<br>
8:3 And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,<br>
<br>
8:4 they say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act.<br>
<br>
8:5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her?<br>
<br>
8:6 And this they said, trying him, that they might have `whereof' to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.<br>
<br>
8:7 But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.<br>
<br>
8:8 And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.<br>
<br>
8:9 And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, `even' unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.<br>
<br>
8:10 And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?<br>
<br>
8:11 And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.<br>
<br>
8:12 Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.<br>
<br>
8:13 The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.<br>
<br>
8:14 Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.<br>
<br>
8:15 Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.<br>
<br>
8:16 Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.<br>
<br>
8:17 Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.<br>
<br>
8:18 I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.<br>
<br>
8:19 They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.<br>
<br>
8:20 These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.<br>
<br>
8:21 He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come.<br>
<br>
8:22 The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?<br>
<br>
8:23 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.<br>
<br>
8:24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am `he', ye shall die in your sins.<br>
<br>
8:25 They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.<br>
<br>
8:26 I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.<br>
<br>
8:27 They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.<br>
<br>
8:28 Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am `he', and `that' I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.<br>
<br>
8:29 And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.<br>
<br>
8:30 As he spake these things, many believed on him.<br>
<br>
8:31 Jesus therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word, `then' are ye truly my disciples;<br>
<br>
8:32 and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.<br>
<br>
8:33 They answered unto him, We are Abraham's seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?<br>
<br>
8:34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.<br>
<br>
8:35 And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.<br>
<br>
8:36 If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.<br>
<br>
8:37 I know that ye are Abraham's seed: yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.<br>
<br>
8:38 I speak the things which I have seen with `my' Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from `your' father.<br>
<br>
8:39 They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.<br>
<br>
8:40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.<br>
<br>
8:41 Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, `even' God.<br>
<br>
8:42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.<br>
<br>
8:43 Why do ye not understand my speech? `Even' because ye cannot hear my word.<br>
<br>
8:44 Ye are of `your' father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.<br>
<br>
8:45 But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.<br>
<br>
8:46 Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?<br>
<br>
8:47 He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear `them' not, because ye are not of God.<br>
<br>
8:48 The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?<br>
<br>
8:49 Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.<br>
<br>
8:50 But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.<br>
<br>
8:51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.<br>
<br>
8:52 The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.<br>
<br>
8:53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself?<br>
<br>
8:54 Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God;<br>
<br>
8:55 and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.<br>
<br>
8:56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.<br>
<br>
8:57 The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?<br>
<br>
8:58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born, I am.<br>
<br>
8:59 They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.<br>
