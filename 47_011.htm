<blockquote>
11:1 Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: but indeed ye do bear with me.<br>
<br>
11:2 For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you `as' a pure virgin to Christ.<br>
<br>
11:3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ.<br>
<br>
11:4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or `if' ye receive a different spirit, which ye did not receive, or a different gospel, which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with `him'.<br>
<br>
11:5 For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.<br>
<br>
11:6 But though `I be' rude in speech, yet `am I' not in knowledge; nay, in every way have we made `this' manifest unto you in all things.<br>
<br>
11:7 Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God for nought?<br>
<br>
11:8 I robbed other churches, taking wages `of them' that I might minister unto you;<br>
<br>
11:9 and when I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brethren, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and `so' will I keep `myself'.<br>
<br>
11:10 As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia.<br>
<br>
11:11 Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.<br>
<br>
11:12 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.<br>
<br>
11:13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.<br>
<br>
11:14 And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light.<br>
<br>
11:15 It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.<br>
<br>
11:16 I say again, let no man think me foolish; but if `ye do', yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little.<br>
<br>
11:17 That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying.<br>
<br>
11:18 Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.<br>
<br>
11:19 For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise `yourselves'.<br>
<br>
11:20 For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you `captive', if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face.<br>
<br>
11:21 I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.<br>
<br>
11:22 Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.<br>
<br>
11:23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft.<br>
<br>
11:24 Of the Jews five times received I forty `stripes' save one.<br>
<br>
11:25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep;<br>
<br>
11:26 `in' journeyings often, `in' perils of rivers, `in' perils of robbers, `in' perils from `my' countrymen, `in' perils from the Gentiles, `in' perils in the city, `in' perils in the wilderness, `in' perils in the sea, `in' perils among false brethren;<br>
<br>
11:27 `in' labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.<br>
<br>
11:28 Besides those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches.<br>
<br>
11:29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and I burn not?<br>
<br>
11:30 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness.<br>
<br>
11:31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not.<br>
<br>
11:32 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me:<br>
<br>
11:33 and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.<br>
