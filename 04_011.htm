<blockquote>
11:1 And the people were as murmurers, `speaking' evil in the ears of Jehovah: and when Jehovah heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of Jehovah burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp.<br>
<br>
11:2 And the people cried unto Moses; and Moses prayed unto Jehovah, and the fire abated.<br>
<br>
11:3 And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of Jehovah burnt among them.<br>
<br>
11:4 And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?<br>
<br>
11:5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic:<br>
<br>
11:6 but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save this manna to look upon.<br>
<br>
11:7 And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium.<br>
<br>
11:8 The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.<br>
<br>
11:9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.<br>
<br>
11:10 And Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of Jehovah was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.<br>
<br>
11:11 And Moses said unto Jehovah, Wherefore hast thou dealt ill with thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?<br>
<br>
11:12 Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?<br>
<br>
11:13 Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.<br>
<br>
11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.<br>
<br>
11:15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.<br>
<br>
11:16 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.<br>
<br>
11:17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.<br>
<br>
11:18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of Jehovah, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore Jehovah will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.<br>
<br>
11:19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,<br>
<br>
11:20 but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected Jehovah who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?<br>
<br>
11:21 And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.<br>
<br>
11:22 Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?<br>
<br>
11:23 And Jehovah said unto Moses, Is Jehovah's hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.<br>
<br>
11:24 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of Jehovah: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent.<br>
<br>
11:25 And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.<br>
<br>
11:26 But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.<br>
<br>
11:27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.<br>
<br>
11:28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.<br>
<br>
11:29 And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all Jehovah's people were prophets, that Jehovah would put his Spirit upon them!<br>
<br>
11:30 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.<br>
<br>
11:31 And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.<br>
<br>
11:32 And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.<br>
<br>
11:33 While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague.<br>
<br>
11:34 And the name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted.<br>
<br>
11:35 From Kibrothhattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.<br>
