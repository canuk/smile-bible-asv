<blockquote>
26:1 Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am Jehovah your God.<br>
<br>
26:2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am Jehovah.<br>
<br>
26:3 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them;<br>
<br>
26:4 then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.<br>
<br>
26:5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.<br>
<br>
26:6 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.<br>
<br>
26:7 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.<br>
<br>
26:8 And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.<br>
<br>
26:9 And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.<br>
<br>
26:10 And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old because of the new.<br>
<br>
26:11 And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor you.<br>
<br>
26:12 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.<br>
<br>
26:13 I am Jehovah your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.<br>
<br>
26:14 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these commandments;<br>
<br>
26:15 and if ye shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhor mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but break my covenant;<br>
<br>
26:16 I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes, and make the soul to pine away; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.<br>
<br>
26:17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies: they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.<br>
<br>
26:18 And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.<br>
<br>
26:19 And I will break the pride of your power: and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass;<br>
<br>
26:20 and your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.<br>
<br>
26:21 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.<br>
<br>
26:22 And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.<br>
<br>
26:23 And if by these things ye will not be reformed unto me, but will walk contrary unto me;<br>
<br>
26:24 then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.<br>
<br>
26:25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities: and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.<br>
<br>
26:26 When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.<br>
<br>
26:27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto me;<br>
<br>
26:28 then I will walk contrary unto you in wrath; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.<br>
<br>
26:29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.<br>
<br>
26:30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-images, and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols; and my soul shall abhor you.<br>
<br>
26:31 And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors.<br>
<br>
26:32 And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it.<br>
<br>
26:33 And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you: and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.<br>
<br>
26:34 Then shall the land enjoy its sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies' land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy its sabbaths.<br>
<br>
26:35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest, even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.<br>
<br>
26:36 And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies: and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.<br>
<br>
26:37 And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.<br>
<br>
26:38 And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.<br>
<br>
26:39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.<br>
<br>
26:40 And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that, because they walked contrary unto me,<br>
<br>
26:41 I also walked contrary unto them, and brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity;<br>
<br>
26:42 then will I remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.<br>
<br>
26:43 The land also shall be left by them, and shall enjoy its sabbaths, while it lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.<br>
<br>
26:44 And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them; for I am Jehovah their God;<br>
<br>
26:45 but I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am Jehovah.<br>
<br>
26:46 These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which Jehovah made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by Moses.<br>
