<blockquote>
1:1 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.<br>
<br>
1:2 Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way.<br>
<br>
1:3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight;<br>
<br>
1:4 John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.<br>
<br>
1:5 And there went out unto him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; And they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.<br>
<br>
1:6 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and `had' a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey.<br>
<br>
1:7 And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.<br>
<br>
1:8 I baptized you in water; But he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
1:9 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.<br>
<br>
1:10 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:<br>
<br>
1:11 And a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.<br>
<br>
1:12 And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.<br>
<br>
1:13 And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; And he was with the wild beasts; And the angels ministered unto him.<br>
<br>
1:14 Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,<br>
<br>
1:15 and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel.<br>
<br>
1:16 And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishers.<br>
<br>
1:17 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.<br>
<br>
1:18 And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.<br>
<br>
1:19 And going on a little further, he saw James the `son' of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.<br>
<br>
1:20 And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.<br>
<br>
1:21 And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.<br>
<br>
1:22 And they were astonished at his teaching: For he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.<br>
<br>
1:23 And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,<br>
<br>
1:24 saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.<br>
<br>
1:25 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.<br>
<br>
1:26 And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.<br>
<br>
1:27 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.<br>
<br>
1:28 And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.<br>
<br>
1:29 And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.<br>
<br>
1:30 Now Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:<br>
<br>
1:31 and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.<br>
<br>
1:32 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons.<br>
<br>
1:33 And all the city was gathered together at the door.<br>
<br>
1:34 And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.<br>
<br>
1:35 And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.<br>
<br>
1:36 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;<br>
<br>
1:37 and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.<br>
<br>
1:38 And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth.<br>
<br>
1:39 And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.<br>
<br>
1:40 And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.<br>
<br>
1:41 And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean.<br>
<br>
1:42 And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.<br>
<br>
1:43 And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,<br>
<br>
1:44 and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.<br>
<br>
1:45 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.<br>
