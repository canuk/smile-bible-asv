<blockquote>
24:1 But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.<br>
<br>
24:2 And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.<br>
<br>
24:3 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.<br>
<br>
24:4 And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel:<br>
<br>
24:5 and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?<br>
<br>
24:6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,<br>
<br>
24:7 saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.<br>
<br>
24:8 And they remembered his words,<br>
<br>
24:9 and returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.<br>
<br>
24:10 Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the `mother' of James: and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles.<br>
<br>
24:11 And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk; and they disbelieved them.<br>
<br>
24:12 But Peter arose, and ran unto the tomb; and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths by themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass.<br>
<br>
24:13 And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
24:14 And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened.<br>
<br>
24:15 And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.<br>
<br>
24:16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.<br>
<br>
24:17 And he said unto them, What communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad.<br>
<br>
24:18 And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days?<br>
<br>
24:19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:<br>
<br>
24:20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.<br>
<br>
24:21 But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yea and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass.<br>
<br>
24:22 Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;<br>
<br>
24:23 and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.<br>
<br>
24:24 And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.<br>
<br>
24:25 And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!<br>
<br>
24:26 Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?<br>
<br>
24:27 And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.<br>
<br>
24:28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.<br>
<br>
24:29 And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them.<br>
<br>
24:30 And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking `it' he gave to them.<br>
<br>
24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.<br>
<br>
24:32 And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?<br>
<br>
24:33 And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,<br>
<br>
24:34 saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.<br>
<br>
24:35 And they rehearsed the things `that happened' in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.<br>
<br>
24:36 And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace `be' unto you.<br>
<br>
24:37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.<br>
<br>
24:38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart?<br>
<br>
24:39 See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having.<br>
<br>
24:40 And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.<br>
<br>
24:41 And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?<br>
<br>
24:42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.<br>
<br>
24:43 And he took it, and ate before them.<br>
<br>
24:44 And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.<br>
<br>
24:45 Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures;<br>
<br>
24:46 and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;<br>
<br>
24:47 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
24:48 Ye are witnesses of these things.<br>
<br>
24:49 And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.<br>
<br>
24:50 And he led them out until `they were' over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.<br>
<br>
24:51 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.<br>
<br>
24:52 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:<br>
<br>
24:53 and were continually in the temple, blessing God.<br>
<br>
