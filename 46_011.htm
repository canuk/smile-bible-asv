<blockquote>
11:1 Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.<br>
<br>
11:2 Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.<br>
<br>
11:3 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.<br>
<br>
11:4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.<br>
<br>
11:5 But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.<br>
<br>
11:6 For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.<br>
<br>
11:7 For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.<br>
<br>
11:8 For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man:<br>
<br>
11:9 for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man:<br>
<br>
11:10 for this cause ought the woman to have `a sign of' authority on her head, because of the angels.<br>
<br>
11:11 Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.<br>
<br>
11:12 For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.<br>
<br>
11:13 Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled?<br>
<br>
11:14 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him?<br>
<br>
11:15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.<br>
<br>
11:16 But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.<br>
<br>
11:17 But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse.<br>
<br>
11:18 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it.<br>
<br>
11:19 For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.<br>
<br>
11:20 When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord's supper:<br>
<br>
11:21 for in your eating each one taketh before `other' his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.<br>
<br>
11:22 What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.<br>
<br>
11:23 For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;<br>
<br>
11:24 and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.<br>
<br>
11:25 In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink `it', in remembrance of me.<br>
<br>
11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord's death till he come.<br>
<br>
11:27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.<br>
<br>
11:28 But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.<br>
<br>
11:29 For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.<br>
<br>
11:30 For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.<br>
<br>
11:31 But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.<br>
<br>
11:32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.<br>
<br>
11:33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.<br>
<br>
11:34 If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.<br>
