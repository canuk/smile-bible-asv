<blockquote>
2:1 And Jehovah spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,<br>
<br>
2:2 The children of Israel shall encamp every man by his own standard, with the ensigns of their fathers' houses: over against the tent of meeting shall they encamp round about.<br>
<br>
2:3 And those that encamp on the east side toward the sunrising shall be they of the standard of the camp of Judah, according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Judah shall be Nahshon the son of Amminadab.<br>
<br>
2:4 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.<br>
<br>
2:5 And those that encamp next unto him shall be the tribe of Issachar: and the prince of the children of Issachar shall be Nethanel the son of Zuar.<br>
<br>
2:6 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and four thousand and four hundred.<br>
<br>
2:7 `And' the tribe of Zebulun: and the prince of the children of Zebulun shall be Eliab the son of Helon.<br>
<br>
2:8 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred.<br>
<br>
2:9 All that were numbered of the camp of Judah were a hundred thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four hundred, according to their hosts. They shall set forth first.<br>
<br>
2:10 On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.<br>
<br>
2:11 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty and six thousand and five hundred.<br>
<br>
2:12 And those that encamp next unto him shall be the tribe of Simeon: and the prince of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.<br>
<br>
2:13 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and nine thousand and three hundred.<br>
<br>
2:14 And the tribe of Gad: and the prince of the children of Gad shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.<br>
<br>
2:15 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty and five thousand and six hundred and fifty.<br>
<br>
2:16 All that were numbered of the camp of Reuben were a hundred thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty, according to their hosts. And they shall set forth second.<br>
<br>
2:17 Then the tent of meeting shall set forward, with the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camps: as they encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place, by their standards.<br>
<br>
2:18 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.<br>
<br>
2:19 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty thousand and five hundred.<br>
<br>
2:20 And next unto him shall be the tribe of Manasseh: and the prince of the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.<br>
<br>
2:21 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and two thousand and two hundred.<br>
<br>
2:22 And the tribe of Benjamin: and the prince of the children of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.<br>
<br>
2:23 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred.<br>
<br>
2:24 All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were a hundred thousand and eight thousand and a hundred, according to their hosts. And they shall set forth third.<br>
<br>
2:25 On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan according to their hosts: and the prince of the children of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.<br>
<br>
2:26 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.<br>
<br>
2:27 And those that encamp next unto him shall be the tribe of Asher: and the prince of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son of Ochran.<br>
<br>
2:28 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty and one thousand and five hundred.<br>
<br>
2:29 And the tribe of Naphtali: and the prince of the children of Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.<br>
<br>
2:30 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.<br>
<br>
2:31 All that were numbered of the camp of Dan were a hundred thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred. They shall set forth hindmost by their standards.<br>
<br>
2:32 These are they that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers' houses: all that were numbered of the camps according to their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.<br>
<br>
2:33 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as Jehovah commanded Moses.<br>
<br>
2:34 Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so they encamped by their standards, and so they set forward, every one by their families, according to their fathers' houses.<br>
