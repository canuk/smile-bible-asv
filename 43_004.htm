<blockquote>
4:1 When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John<br>
<br>
4:2 (although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),<br>
<br>
4:3 he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.<br>
<br>
4:4 And he must needs pass through Samaria.<br>
<br>
4:5 So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:<br>
<br>
4:6 and Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.<br>
<br>
4:7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.<br>
<br>
4:8 For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.<br>
<br>
4:9 The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)<br>
<br>
4:10 Jesus answered and said unto unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.<br>
<br>
4:11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?<br>
<br>
4:12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?<br>
<br>
4:13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:<br>
<br>
4:14 but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.<br>
<br>
4:15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.<br>
<br>
4:16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.<br>
<br>
4:17 The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:<br>
<br>
4:18 for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.<br>
<br>
4:19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.<br>
<br>
4:20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.<br>
<br>
4:21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.<br>
<br>
4:22 Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.<br>
<br>
4:23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.<br>
<br>
4:24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.<br>
<br>
4:25 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.<br>
<br>
4:26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am `he'.<br>
<br>
4:27 And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?<br>
<br>
4:28 So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people,<br>
<br>
4:29 Come, see a man, who told me all things that `ever' I did: can this be the Christ?<br>
<br>
4:30 They went out of the city, and were coming to him.<br>
<br>
4:31 In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.<br>
<br>
4:32 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.<br>
<br>
4:33 The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him `aught' to eat?<br>
<br>
4:34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.<br>
<br>
4:35 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and `then' cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.<br>
<br>
4:36 He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.<br>
<br>
4:37 For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.<br>
<br>
4:38 I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.<br>
<br>
4:39 And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that `ever' I did.<br>
<br>
4:40 So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.<br>
<br>
4:41 And many more believed because of his word;<br>
<br>
4:42 and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.<br>
<br>
4:43 And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.<br>
<br>
4:44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.<br>
<br>
4:45 So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.<br>
<br>
4:46 He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.<br>
<br>
4:47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought `him' that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.<br>
<br>
4:48 Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.<br>
<br>
4:49 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.<br>
<br>
4:50 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.<br>
<br>
4:51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.<br>
<br>
4:52 So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.<br>
<br>
4:53 So the father knew that `it was' at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.<br>
<br>
4:54 This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.<br>
<br>
