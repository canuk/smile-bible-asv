<blockquote>
15:1 And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.<br>
<br>
15:2 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.<br>
<br>
15:3 And the chief priests accused him of many things.<br>
<br>
15:4 And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.<br>
<br>
15:5 But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marvelled.<br>
<br>
15:6 Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.<br>
<br>
15:7 And there was one called Barabbas, `lying' bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.<br>
<br>
15:8 And the multitude went up and began to ask him `to do' as he was wont to do unto them.<br>
<br>
15:9 And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?<br>
<br>
15:10 For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.<br>
<br>
15:11 But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.<br>
<br>
15:12 And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?<br>
<br>
15:13 And they cried out again, Crucify him.<br>
<br>
15:14 And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.<br>
<br>
15:15 And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.<br>
<br>
15:16 And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.<br>
<br>
15:17 And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;<br>
<br>
15:18 and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!<br>
<br>
15:19 And they smote his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.<br>
<br>
15:20 And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him.<br>
<br>
15:21 And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go `with them', that he might bear his cross.<br>
<br>
15:22 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.<br>
<br>
15:23 And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.<br>
<br>
15:24 And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take.<br>
<br>
15:25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.<br>
<br>
15:26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br>
<br>
15:27 And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.<br>
<br>
15:28 `And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was reckoned with transgressors.'<br>
<br>
15:29 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,<br>
<br>
15:30 save thyself, and come down from the cross.<br>
<br>
15:31 In like manner also the chief priests mocking `him' among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.<br>
<br>
15:32 Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.<br>
<br>
15:33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.<br>
<br>
15:34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?<br>
<br>
15:35 And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.<br>
<br>
15:36 And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down.<br>
<br>
15:37 And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.<br>
<br>
15:38 And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.<br>
<br>
15:39 And when the centurion, who stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.<br>
<br>
15:40 And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom `were' both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;<br>
<br>
15:41 who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women that came up with him unto Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
15:42 And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,<br>
<br>
15:43 there came Joseph of Arimathaea, a councillor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.<br>
<br>
15:44 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.<br>
<br>
15:45 And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.<br>
<br>
15:46 And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.<br>
<br>
15:47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the `mother' of Joses beheld where he was laid.<br>
