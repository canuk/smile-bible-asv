<blockquote>
8:1 Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the churches of Macedonia;<br>
<br>
8:2 how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.<br>
<br>
8:3 For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, `they gave' of their own accord,<br>
<br>
8:4 beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints:<br>
<br>
8:5 and `this', not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.<br>
<br>
8:6 Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also.<br>
<br>
8:7 But as ye abound in everything, `in' faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and `in' all earnestness, and `in' your love to us, `see' that ye abound in this grace also.<br>
<br>
8:8 I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.<br>
<br>
8:9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich.<br>
<br>
8:10 And herein I give `my' judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will.<br>
<br>
8:11 But now complete the doing also; that as `there was' the readiness to will, so `there may be' the completion also out of your ability.<br>
<br>
8:12 For if the readiness is there, `it is' acceptable according as `a man' hath, not according as `he' hath not.<br>
<br>
8:13 For `I say' not `this' that others may be eased `and' ye distressed;<br>
<br>
8:14 but by equality: your abundance `being a supply' at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become `a supply' for your want; that there may be equality:<br>
<br>
8:15 as it is written, He that `gathered' much had nothing over; and he that `gathered' little had no lack.<br>
<br>
8:16 But thanks be to God, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.<br>
<br>
8:17 For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord.<br>
<br>
8:18 And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the gospel `is spread' through all the churches;<br>
<br>
8:19 and not only so, but who was also appointed by the churches to travel with us in `the matter of' this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord, and `to show' our readiness:<br>
<br>
8:20 Avoiding this, that any man should blame us in `the matter of' this bounty which is ministered by us:<br>
<br>
8:21 for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.<br>
<br>
8:22 and we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which `he hath' in you.<br>
<br>
8:23 Whether `any inquire' about Titus, `he is' my partner and `my' fellow-worker to you-ward, or our brethren, `they are' the messengers of the churches, `they are' the glory of Christ.<br>
<br>
8:24 Show ye therefore unto them in the face of the churches the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf.<br>
