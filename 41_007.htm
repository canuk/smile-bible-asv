<blockquote>
7:1 And there are gathered together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,<br>
<br>
7:2 and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands.<br>
<br>
7:3 (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders;<br>
<br>
7:4 and `when they come' from the market-place, except they bathe themselves, they eat not; and many other things there are, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels.)<br>
<br>
7:5 And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with defiled hands?<br>
<br>
7:6 And he said unto them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoreth me with their lips, But their heart is far from me.<br>
<br>
7:7 But in vain do they worship me, Teaching `as their' doctrines the precepts of men.<br>
<br>
7:8 Ye leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.<br>
<br>
7:9 And he said unto them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition.<br>
<br>
7:10 For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death:<br>
<br>
7:11 but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given `to God';<br>
<br>
7:12 ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother;<br>
<br>
7:13 making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.<br>
<br>
7:14 And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand:<br>
<br>
7:15 there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.<br>
<br>
7:16 `If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.'<br>
<br>
7:17 And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable.<br>
<br>
7:18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, `it' cannot defile him;<br>
<br>
7:19 because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? `This he said', making all meats clean.<br>
<br>
7:20 And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man.<br>
<br>
7:21 For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,<br>
<br>
7:22 covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:<br>
<br>
7:23 all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.<br>
<br>
7:24 And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid.<br>
<br>
7:25 But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.<br>
<br>
7:26 Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.<br>
<br>
7:27 And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs.<br>
<br>
7:28 But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.<br>
<br>
7:29 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter.<br>
<br>
7:30 And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out.<br>
<br>
7:31 And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.<br>
<br>
7:32 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him.<br>
<br>
7:33 And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue;<br>
<br>
7:34 and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.<br>
<br>
7:35 And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.<br>
<br>
7:36 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it.<br>
<br>
7:37 And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.<br>
