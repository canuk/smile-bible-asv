<blockquote>
16:1 And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods.<br>
<br>
16:2 And he called him, and said unto him, What is this that I hear of thee? render the account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer steward.<br>
<br>
16:3 And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed.<br>
<br>
16:4 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.<br>
<br>
16:5 And calling to him each one of his lord's debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?<br>
<br>
16:6 And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty.<br>
<br>
16:7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. He saith unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore.<br>
<br>
16:8 And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light.<br>
<br>
16:9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.<br>
<br>
16:10 He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much.<br>
<br>
16:11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true `riches'?<br>
<br>
16:12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another's, who will give you that which is your own?<br>
<br>
16:13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.<br>
<br>
16:14 And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him.<br>
<br>
16:15 And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.<br>
<br>
16:16 The law and the prophets `were' until John: from that time the gospel of the kingdom of God is preached, and every man entereth violently into it.<br>
<br>
16:17 But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall.<br>
<br>
16:18 Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery.<br>
<br>
16:19 Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day:<br>
<br>
16:20 and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,<br>
<br>
16:21 and desiring to be fed with the `crumbs' that fell from the rich man's table; yea, even the dogs come and licked his sores.<br>
<br>
16:22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Abraham's bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried.<br>
<br>
16:23 And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.<br>
<br>
16:24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.<br>
<br>
16:25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted and thou art in anguish.<br>
<br>
16:26 And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us.<br>
<br>
16:27 And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house;<br>
<br>
16:28 for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.<br>
<br>
16:29 But Abraham saith, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.<br>
<br>
16:30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent.<br>
<br>
16:31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.<br>
