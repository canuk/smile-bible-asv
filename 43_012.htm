<blockquote>
12:1 Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.<br>
<br>
12:2 So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.<br>
<br>
12:3 Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.<br>
<br>
12:4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should betray him, saith,<br>
<br>
12:5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings, and given to the poor?<br>
<br>
12:6 Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein.<br>
<br>
12:7 Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying.<br>
<br>
12:8 For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.<br>
<br>
12:9 The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.<br>
<br>
12:10 But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death;<br>
<br>
12:11 because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.<br>
<br>
12:12 On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,<br>
<br>
12:13 took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed `is' he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.<br>
<br>
12:14 And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,<br>
<br>
12:15 Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.<br>
<br>
12:16 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.<br>
<br>
12:17 The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness.<br>
<br>
12:18 For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign.<br>
<br>
12:19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after him.<br>
<br>
12:20 Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast:<br>
<br>
12:21 these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.<br>
<br>
12:22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus.<br>
<br>
12:23 And Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.<br>
<br>
12:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.<br>
<br>
12:25 He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.<br>
<br>
12:26 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honor.<br>
<br>
12:27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour.<br>
<br>
12:28 Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, `saying', I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.<br>
<br>
12:29 The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.<br>
<br>
12:30 Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.<br>
<br>
12:31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.<br>
<br>
12:32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.<br>
<br>
12:33 But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.<br>
<br>
12:34 The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?<br>
<br>
12:35 Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.<br>
<br>
12:36 While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them.<br>
<br>
12:37 But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him:<br>
<br>
12:38 that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?<br>
<br>
12:39 For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,<br>
<br>
12:40 He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, And should turn, And I should heal them.<br>
<br>
12:41 These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spake of him.<br>
<br>
12:42 Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess `it', lest they should be put out of the synagogue:<br>
<br>
12:43 for they loved the glory `that is' of men more than the glory `that is' of God.<br>
<br>
12:44 And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.<br>
<br>
12:45 And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me.<br>
<br>
12:46 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.<br>
<br>
12:47 And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.<br>
<br>
12:48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day.<br>
<br>
12:49 For I spake not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.<br>
<br>
12:50 And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.<br>
<br>
