<blockquote>
10:1 For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;<br>
<br>
10:2 and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;<br>
<br>
10:3 and did all eat the same spiritual food;<br>
<br>
10:4 and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.<br>
<br>
10:5 Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.<br>
<br>
10:6 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.<br>
<br>
10:7 Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.<br>
<br>
10:8 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.<br>
<br>
10:9 Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.<br>
<br>
10:10 Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.<br>
<br>
10:11 Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.<br>
<br>
10:12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.<br>
<br>
10:13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.<br>
<br>
10:14 Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.<br>
<br>
10:15 I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.<br>
<br>
10:16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ?<br>
<br>
10:17 seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we are all partake of the one bread.<br>
<br>
10:18 Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?<br>
<br>
10:19 What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?<br>
<br>
10:20 But `I say', that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons.<br>
<br>
10:21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.<br>
<br>
10:22 Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?<br>
<br>
10:23 All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify.<br>
<br>
10:24 Let no man seek his own, but `each' his neighbor's `good'.<br>
<br>
10:25 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience' sake,<br>
<br>
10:26 for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.<br>
<br>
10:27 If one of them that believe not biddeth you `to a feast', and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience' sake.<br>
<br>
10:28 But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience sake:<br>
<br>
10:29 conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other's; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?<br>
<br>
10:30 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?<br>
<br>
10:31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.<br>
<br>
10:32 Give no occasions of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God:<br>
<br>
10:33 even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the `profit' of the many, that they may be saved.<br>
