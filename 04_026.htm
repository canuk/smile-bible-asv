<br>
26:53 Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names.<br>
<br>
26:54 To the more thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to the fewer thou shalt give the less inheritance: to every one according to those that were numbered of him shall his inheritance be given.<br>
<br>
26:55 Notwithstanding, the land shall be divided by lot: according to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.<br>
<br>

<br>
26:63 These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.<br>
<br>
26:64 But among these there was not a man of them that were numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.<br>
<br>
26:65 For Jehovah had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.<br>
