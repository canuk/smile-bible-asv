<blockquote>
26:1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, he said unto his disciples,<br>
<br>
26:2 Ye know that after two days the passover cometh, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.<br>
<br>
26:3 Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas;<br>
<br>
26:4 and they took counsel together that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.<br>
<br>
26:5 But they said, Not during the feast, lest a tumult arise among people.<br>
<br>
26:6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,<br>
<br>
26:7 there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, as he sat at meat.<br>
<br>
26:8 But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?<br>
<br>
26:9 For this `ointment' might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.<br>
<br>
26:10 But Jesus perceiving it said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.<br>
<br>
26:11 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.<br>
<br>
26:12 For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.<br>
<br>
26:13 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.<br>
<br>
26:14 Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,<br>
<br>
26:15 and said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver.<br>
<br>
26:16 And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him `unto them.'<br>
<br>
26:17 Now on the first `day' of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover?<br>
<br>
26:18 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.<br>
<br>
26:19 And the disciples did as Jesus appointed them; and they made ready the passover.<br>
<br>
26:20 Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples;<br>
<br>
26:21 and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.<br>
<br>
26:22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord?<br>
<br>
26:23 And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.<br>
<br>
26:24 The Son of man goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.<br>
<br>
26:25 And Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast said.<br>
<br>
26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.<br>
<br>
26:27 And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;<br>
<br>
26:28 for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many unto remission of sins.<br>
<br>
26:29 But I say unto you, I shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.<br>
<br>
26:30 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the mount of Olives.<br>
<br>
26:31 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.<br>
<br>
26:32 But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.<br>
<br>
26:33 But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.<br>
<br>
26:34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.<br>
<br>
26:35 Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee, `yet' will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.<br>
<br>
26:36 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray.<br>
<br>
26:37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled.<br>
<br>
26:38 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me.<br>
<br>
26:39 And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.<br>
<br>
26:40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?<br>
<br>
26:41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.<br>
<br>
26:42 Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done.<br>
<br>
26:43 And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.<br>
<br>
26:44 And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.<br>
<br>
26:45 Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.<br>
<br>
26:46 Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.<br>
<br>
26:47 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priest and elders of the people.<br>
<br>
26:48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.<br>
<br>
26:49 And straightway he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.<br>
<br>
26:50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, `do' that for which thou art come. Then they came and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.<br>
<br>
26:51 And behold, one of them that were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.<br>
<br>
26:52 Then saith Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.<br>
<br>
26:53 Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?<br>
<br>
26:54 How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?<br>
<br>
26:55 In that hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not.<br>
<br>
26:56 But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him, and fled.<br>
<br>
26:57 And they that had taken Jesus led him away to `the house of' Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.<br>
<br>
26:58 But Peter followed him afar off, unto the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end.<br>
<br>
26:59 Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death;<br>
<br>
26:60 and they found it not, though many false witnesses came. But afterward came two,<br>
<br>
26:61 and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.<br>
<br>
26:62 And the high priest stood up, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?<br>
<br>
26:63 But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.<br>
<br>
26:64 Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.<br>
<br>
26:65 Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy:<br>
<br>
26:66 what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.<br>
<br>
26:67 Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands,<br>
<br>
26:68 saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck thee?<br>
<br>
26:69 Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilaean.<br>
<br>
26:70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.<br>
<br>
26:71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another `maid' saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.<br>
<br>
26:72 And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.<br>
<br>
26:73 And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art `one' of them; for thy speech maketh thee known.<br>
<br>
26:74 Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And straightway the cock crew.<br>
<br>
26:75 And Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.<br>
