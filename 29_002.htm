<blockquote>
2:1 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of Jehovah cometh, for it is nigh at hand;<br>
<br>
2:2 a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations.<br>
<br>
2:3 A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and none hath escaped them.<br>
<br>
2:4 The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run.<br>
<br>
2:5 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.<br>
<br>
2:6 At their presence the peoples are in anguish; all faces are waxed pale.<br>
<br>
2:7 They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they break not their ranks.<br>
<br>
2:8 Neither doth one thrust another; they march every one in his path; and they burst through the weapons, and break not off `their course'.<br>
<br>
2:9 They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.<br>
<br>
2:10 The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble; the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.<br>
<br>
2:11 And Jehovah uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executeth his word; for the day of Jehovah is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?<br>
<br>
2:12 Yet even now, saith Jehovah, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:<br>
<br>
2:13 and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto Jehovah your God; for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and repenteth him of the evil.<br>
<br>
2:14 Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal-offering and a drink-offering unto Jehovah your God?<br>
<br>
2:15 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly;<br>
<br>
2:16 gather the people, sanctify the assembly, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth from his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.<br>
<br>
2:17 Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O Jehovah, and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?<br>
<br>
2:18 Then was Jehovah jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.<br>
<br>
2:19 And Jehovah answered and said unto his people, Behold, I will send you grain, and new wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith; and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations;<br>
<br>
2:20 but I will remove far off from you the northern `army', and will drive it into a land barren and desolate, its forepart into the eastern sea, and its hinder part into the western sea; and its stench shall come up, and its ill savor shall come up, because it hath done great things.<br>
<br>
2:21 Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for Jehovah hath done great things.<br>
<br>
2:22 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine do yield their strength.<br>
<br>
2:23 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in Jehovah your God; for he giveth you the former rain in just measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first `month'.<br>
<br>
2:24 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil.<br>
<br>
2:25 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the canker-worm, and the caterpillar, and the palmer-worm, my great army which I sent among you.<br>
<br>
2:26 And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of Jehovah your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you; and my people shall never be put to shame.<br>
<br>
2:27 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am Jehovah your God, and there is none else; and my people shall never be put to shame.<br>
<br>
2:28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:<br>
<br>
2:29 and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my Spirit.<br>
<br>
2:30 And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth: blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.<br>
<br>
2:31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh.<br>
<br>
2:32 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be delivered; for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as Jehovah hath said, and among the remnant those whom Jehovah doth call.<br>
