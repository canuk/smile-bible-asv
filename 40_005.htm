<blockquote>
5:1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain: and when he had sat down, his disciples came unto him:<br>
<br>
5:2 and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying,<br>
<br>
5:3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
<br>
5:4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.<br>
<br>
5:5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.<br>
<br>
5:6 Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.<br>
<br>
5:7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.<br>
<br>
5:8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.<br>
<br>
5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called sons of God.<br>
<br>
5:10 Blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br>
<br>
5:11 Blessed are ye when `men' shall reproach you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.<br>
<br>
5:12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you.<br>
<br>
5:13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savor, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men.<br>
<br>
5:14 Ye are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid.<br>
<br>
5:15 Neither do `men' light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand; and it shineth unto all that are in the house.<br>
<br>
5:16 Even so let your light shine before men; that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.<br>
<br>
5:17 Think not that I came to destroy the law or the prophets: I came not to destroy, but to fulfil.<br>
<br>
5:18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass away from the law, till all things be accomplished.<br>
<br>
5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<br>
<br>
5:20 For I say unto you, that except your righteousness shall exceed `the righteousness' of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br>
<br>
5:21 Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:<br>
<br>
5:22 but I say unto you, that every one who is angry with his brother shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire.<br>
<br>
5:23 If therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against thee,<br>
<br>
5:24 leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.<br>
<br>
5:25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art with him in the way; lest haply the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.<br>
<br>
5:26 Verily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou have paid the last farthing.<br>
<br>
5:27 Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not commit adultery:<br>
<br>
5:28 but I say unto you, that every one that looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.<br>
<br>
5:29 And if thy right eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell.<br>
<br>
5:30 And if thy right hand causeth thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body go into hell.<br>
<br>
5:31 It was said also, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:<br>
<br>
5:32 but I say unto you, that every one that putteth away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, maketh her an adulteress: and whosoever shall marry her when she is put away committeth adultery.<br>
<br>
5:33 Again, ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:<br>
<br>
5:34 but I say unto you, swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne of God;<br>
<br>
5:35 nor by the earth, for it is the footstool of his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.<br>
<br>
5:36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black.<br>
<br>
5:37 But let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: and whatsoever is more than these is of the evil `one'.<br>
<br>
5:38 Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:<br>
<br>
5:39 but I say unto you, resist not him that is evil: but whosoever smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.<br>
<br>
5:40 And if any man would go to law with thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.<br>
<br>
5:41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go one mile, go with him two.<br>
<br>
5:42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.<br>
<br>
5:43 Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy:<br>
<br>
5:44 but I say unto you, love your enemies, and pray for them that persecute you;<br>
<br>
5:45 that ye may be sons of your Father who is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust.<br>
<br>
5:46 For if ye love them that love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?<br>
<br>
5:47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more `than others?' do not even the Gentiles the same?<br>
<br>
5:48 Ye therefore shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.<br>
<br>
