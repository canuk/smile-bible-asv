<blockquote>
19:1 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.<br>
<br>
19:2 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment;<br>
<br>
19:3 and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands.<br>
<br>
19:4 And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him.<br>
<br>
19:5 Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And `Pilate' saith unto them, Behold, the man!<br>
<br>
19:6 When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify `him', crucify `him'! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.<br>
<br>
19:7 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.<br>
<br>
19:8 When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;<br>
<br>
19:9 and he entered into the Praetorium again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.<br>
<br>
19:10 Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?<br>
<br>
19:11 Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.<br>
<br>
19:12 Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar's friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.<br>
<br>
19:13 When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.<br>
<br>
19:14 Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!<br>
<br>
19:15 They therefore cried out, Away with `him', away with `him', crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.<br>
<br>
19:16 Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.<br>
<br>
19:17 They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:<br>
<br>
19:18 where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.<br>
<br>
19:19 And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br>
<br>
19:20 This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, `and' in Latin, `and' in Greek.<br>
<br>
19:21 The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.<br>
<br>
19:22 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.<br>
<br>
19:23 The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.<br>
<br>
19:24 They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots.<br>
<br>
19:25 These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the `wife' of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.<br>
<br>
19:26 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!<br>
<br>
19:27 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own `home'.<br>
<br>
19:28 After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.<br>
<br>
19:29 There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.<br>
<br>
19:30 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.<br>
<br>
19:31 The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high `day'), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and `that' they might be taken away.<br>
<br>
19:32 The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:<br>
<br>
19:33 but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:<br>
<br>
19:34 howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.<br>
<br>
19:35 And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.<br>
<br>
19:36 For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.<br>
<br>
19:37 And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.<br>
<br>
19:38 And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave `him' leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.<br>
<br>
19:39 And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.<br>
<br>
19:40 So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.<br>
<br>
19:41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.<br>
<br>
19:42 There then because of the Jews' Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.<br>
