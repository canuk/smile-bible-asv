<blockquote>
25:1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.<br>
<br>
25:2 And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.<br>
<br>
25:3 For the foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them:<br>
<br>
25:4 but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.<br>
<br>
25:5 Now while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.<br>
<br>
25:6 But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him.<br>
<br>
25:7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.<br>
<br>
25:8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.<br>
<br>
25:9 But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.<br>
<br>
25:10 And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut.<br>
<br>
25:11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.<br>
<br>
25:12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.<br>
<br>
25:13 Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.<br>
<br>
25:14 For `it is' as `when' a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.<br>
<br>
25:15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey.<br>
<br>
25:16 Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents.<br>
<br>
25:17 In like manner he also that `received' the two gained other two.<br>
<br>
25:18 But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.<br>
<br>
25:19 Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.<br>
<br>
25:20 And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents.<br>
<br>
25:21 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<br>
<br>
25:22 And he also that `received' the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents.<br>
<br>
25:23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.<br>
<br>
25:24 And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter;<br>
<br>
25:25 and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own.<br>
<br>
25:26 But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter;<br>
<br>
25:27 thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest.<br>
<br>
25:28 Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.<br>
<br>
25:29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away.<br>
<br>
25:30 And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.<br>
<br>
25:31 But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:<br>
<br>
25:32 and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats;<br>
<br>
25:33 and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.<br>
<br>
25:34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:<br>
<br>
25:35 for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;<br>
<br>
25:36 naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.<br>
<br>
25:37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink?<br>
<br>
25:38 And when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?<br>
<br>
25:39 And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?<br>
<br>
25:40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, `even' these least, ye did it unto me.<br>
<br>
25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels:<br>
<br>
25:42 for I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;<br>
<br>
25:43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.<br>
<br>
25:44 Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?<br>
<br>
25:45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me.<br>
<br>
25:46 And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.<br>
<br>
