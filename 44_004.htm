<blockquote>
4:1 And as they spake unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,<br>
<br>
4:2 being sore troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.<br>
<br>
4:3 And they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now eventide.<br>
<br>
4:4 But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.<br>
<br>
4:5 And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem;<br>
<br>
4:6 and Annas the high priest `was there', and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.<br>
<br>
4:7 And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this?<br>
<br>
4:8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders,<br>
<br>
4:9 if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole;<br>
<br>
4:10 be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, `even' in him doth this man stand here before you whole.<br>
<br>
4:11 He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the head of the corner.<br>
<br>
4:12 And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved.<br>
<br>
4:13 Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.<br>
<br>
4:14 And seeing the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.<br>
<br>
4:15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,<br>
<br>
4:16 saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.<br>
<br>
4:17 But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.<br>
<br>
4:18 And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.<br>
<br>
4:19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye:<br>
<br>
4:20 for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.<br>
<br>
4:21 And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified God for that which was done.<br>
<br>
4:22 For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought.<br>
<br>
4:23 And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them.<br>
<br>
4:24 And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is:<br>
<br>
4:25 who by the Holy Spirit, `by' the mouth of our father David thy servant, didst say, Why did the Gentiles rage, And the peoples imagine vain things?<br>
<br>
4:26 The kings of the earth set themselves in array, And the rulers were gathered together, Against the Lord, and against his Anointed:<br>
<br>
4:27 for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant Jesus, whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together,<br>
<br>
4:28 to do whatsoever thy hand and thy council foreordained to come to pass.<br>
<br>
4:29 And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness,<br>
<br>
4:30 while thy stretchest forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant Jesus.<br>
<br>
4:31 And when they had prayed, the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness.<br>
<br>
4:32 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one `of them' said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.<br>
<br>
4:33 And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.<br>
<br>
4:34 For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,<br>
<br>
4:35 and laid them at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need.<br>
<br>
4:36 And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,<br>
<br>
4:37 having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.<br>
