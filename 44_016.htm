<blockquote>
16:1 And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek.<br>
<br>
16:2 The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.<br>
<br>
16:3 Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.<br>
<br>
16:4 And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
16:5 So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.<br>
<br>
16:6 And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;<br>
<br>
16:7 and when they were come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not;<br>
<br>
16:8 and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.<br>
<br>
16:9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.<br>
<br>
16:10 And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.<br>
<br>
16:11 Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis;<br>
<br>
16:12 and from thence to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a `Roman' colony: and we were in this city tarrying certain days.<br>
<br>
16:13 And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that were come together.<br>
<br>
16:14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul.<br>
<br>
16:15 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide `there'. And she constrained us.<br>
<br>
16:16 And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.<br>
<br>
16:17 The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation.<br>
<br>
16:18 And this she did for many days. But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour.<br>
<br>
16:19 But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers,<br>
<br>
16:20 and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,<br>
<br>
16:21 and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.<br>
<br>
16:22 And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.<br>
<br>
16:23 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely:<br>
<br>
16:24 who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.<br>
<br>
16:25 But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God, and the prisoners were listening to them;<br>
<br>
16:26 and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed.<br>
<br>
16:27 And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.<br>
<br>
16:28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.<br>
<br>
16:29 And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas,<br>
<br>
16:30 and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?<br>
<br>
16:31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.<br>
<br>
16:32 And they spake the word of the Lord unto him, with all that were in his house.<br>
<br>
16:33 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.<br>
<br>
16:34 And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in God.<br>
<br>
16:35 But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.<br>
<br>
16:36 And the jailor reported the words to Paul, `saying', The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace.<br>
<br>
16:37 But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? Nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.<br>
<br>
16:38 And the sergeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans;<br>
<br>
16:39 and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.<br>
<br>
16:40 And they went out of the prison, and entered into `the house' of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.<br>
