<blockquote>
11:1 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and one said, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.<br>
<br>
11:2 And the court which is without the temple leave without, and measure it not; for it hath been given unto the nations: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.<br>
<br>
11:3 And I will give unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.<br>
<br>
11:4 These are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks, standing before the Lord of the earth.<br>
<br>
11:5 And if any man desireth to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies; and if any man shall desire to hurt them, in this manner must he be killed.<br>
<br>
11:6 These have the power to shut the heaven, that it rain not during the days of their prophecy: and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they shall desire.<br>
<br>
11:7 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.<br>
<br>
11:8 And their dead bodies `lie' in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.<br>
<br>
11:9 And from among the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations do `men' look upon their dead bodies three days and a half, and suffer not their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.<br>
<br>
11:10 And they that dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and make merry; and they shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth.<br>
<br>
11:11 And after the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them that beheld them.<br>
<br>
11:12 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they went up into heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them.<br>
<br>
11:13 And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell; and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand persons: and the rest were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.<br>
<br>
11:14 The second Woe is past: behold, the third Woe cometh quickly.<br>
<br>
11:15 And the seventh angel sounded; and there followed great voices in heaven, and they said, The kingdom of the world is become `the kingdom' of our Lord, and of his Christ: and he shall reign for ever and ever.<br>
<br>
11:16 And the four and twenty elders, who sit before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God,<br>
<br>
11:17 saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Almighty, who art and who wast; because thou hast taken thy great power, and didst reign.<br>
<br>
11:18 And the nations were wroth, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead to be judged, and `the time' to give their reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to them that fear thy name, the small and the great; and to destroy them that destroy the earth.<br>
<br>
11:19 And there was opened the temple of God that is in heaven; and there was seen in his temple the ark of his covenant; and there followed lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail.<br>
