<blockquote>
119:1 ALEPH. Blessed are they that are perfect in the way, Who walk in the law of Jehovah.<br>
<br>
119:2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, That seek him with the whole heart.<br>
<br>
119:3 Yea, they do no unrighteousness; They walk in his ways.<br>
<br>
119:4 Thou hast commanded `us' thy precepts, That we should observe them diligently.<br>
<br>
119:5 Oh that my ways were established To observe thy statutes!<br>
<br>
119:6 Then shall I not be put to shame, When I have respect unto all thy commandments.<br>
<br>
119:7 I will give thanks unto thee with uprightness of heart, When I learn thy righteous judgments.<br>
<br>
119:8 I will observe thy statutes: Oh forsake me not utterly.<br>
<br>
119:9 BETH. Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? By taking heed `thereto' according to thy word.<br>
<br>
119:10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: Oh let me not wander from thy commandments.<br>
<br>
119:11 Thy word have I laid up in my heart, That I might not sin against thee.<br>
<br>
119:12 Blessed art thou, O Jehovah: Teach me thy statutes.<br>
<br>
119:13 With my lips have I declared All the ordinances of thy mouth.<br>
<br>
119:14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, As much as in all riches.<br>
<br>
119:15 I will meditate on thy precepts, And have respect unto thy ways.<br>
<br>
119:16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.<br>
<br>
119:17 GIMEL. Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live; So will I observe thy word.<br>
<br>
119:18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold Wondrous things out of thy law.<br>
<br>
119:19 I am a sojourner in the earth: Hide not thy commandments from me.<br>
<br>
119:20 My soul breaketh for the longing That it hath unto thine ordinances at all times.<br>
<br>
119:21 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, That do wander from thy commandments.<br>
<br>
119:22 Take away from me reproach and contempt; For I have kept thy testimonies.<br>
<br>
119:23 Princes also sat and talked against me; `But' thy servant did meditate on thy statutes.<br>
<br>
119:24 Thy testimonies also are my delight `And' my counsellors.<br>
<br>
119:25 DALETH. My soul cleaveth unto the dust: Quicken thou me according to thy word.<br>
<br>
119:26 I declared my ways, and thou answeredst me: Teach me thy statutes.<br>
<br>
119:27 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: So shall I meditate on thy wondrous works.<br>
<br>
119:28 My soul melteth for heaviness: Strengthen thou me according unto thy word.<br>
<br>
119:29 Remove from me the way of falsehood; And grant me thy law graciously.<br>
<br>
119:30 I have chosen the way of faithfulness: Thine ordinances have I set `before me'.<br>
<br>
119:31 I cleave unto thy testimonies: O Jehovah, put me not to shame.<br>
<br>
119:32 I will run the way of thy commandments, When thou shalt enlarge my heart.<br>
<br>
119:33 HE. Teach me, O Jehovah, the way of thy statutes; And I shall keep it unto the end.<br>
<br>
119:34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; Yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.<br>
<br>
119:35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; For therein do I delight.<br>
<br>
119:36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, And not to covetousness.<br>
<br>
119:37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, And quicken me in thy ways.<br>
<br>
119:38 Confirm unto thy servant thy word, Which `is in order' unto the fear of thee.<br>
<br>
119:39 Turn away my reproach whereof I am afraid; For thine ordinances are good.<br>
<br>
119:40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: Quicken me in thy righteousness.<br>
<br>
119:41 VAV. Let thy lovingkindnesses also come unto me, O Jehovah, Even thy salvation, according to thy word.<br>
<br>
119:42 So shall I have an answer for him that reproacheth me; For I trust in thy word.<br>
<br>
119:43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; For I have hoped in thine ordinances.<br>
<br>
119:44 So shall I observe thy law continually For ever and ever.<br>
<br>
119:45 And I shall walk at liberty; For I have sought thy precepts.<br>
<br>
119:46 I will also speak of thy testimonies before kings, And shall not be put to shame.<br>
<br>
119:47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, Which I have loved.<br>
<br>
119:48 I will lift up my hands also unto thy commandments, which I have loved; And I will meditate on thy statutes.<br>
<br>
119:49 ZAYIN. Remember the word unto thy servant, Because thou hast made me to hope.<br>
<br>
119:50 This is my comfort in my affliction; For thy word hath quickened me.<br>
<br>
119:51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: `Yet' have I not swerved from thy law.<br>
<br>
119:52 I have remembered thine ordinances of old, O Jehovah, And have comforted myself.<br>
<br>
119:53 Hot indignation hath taken hold upon me, Because of the wicked that forsake thy law.<br>
<br>
119:54 Thy statutes have been my songs In the house of my pilgrimage.<br>
<br>
119:55 I have remembered thy name, O Jehovah, in the night, And have observed thy law.<br>
<br>
119:56 This I have had, Because I have kept thy precepts.<br>
<br>
119:57 HHETH. Jehovah is my portion: I have said that I would observe thy words.<br>
<br>
119:58 I entreated thy favor with my whole heart: Be merciful unto me according to thy word.<br>
<br>
119:59 I thought on my ways, And turned my feet unto thy testimonies.<br>
<br>
119:60 I made haste, and delayed not, To observe thy commandments.<br>
<br>
119:61 The cords of the wicked have wrapped me round; `But' I have not forgotten thy law.<br>
<br>
119:62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee Because of thy righteous ordinances.<br>
<br>
119:63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, And of them that observe thy precepts.<br>
<br>
119:64 The earth, O Jehovah, is full of thy lovingkindness: Teach me thy statutes.<br>
<br>
119:65 TETH. Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O Jehovah, according unto thy word.<br>
<br>
119:66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge; For I have believed in thy commandments.<br>
<br>
119:67 Before I was afflicted I went astray; But now I observe thy word.<br>
<br>
119:68 Thou art good, and doest good; Teach me thy statutes.<br>
<br>
119:69 The proud have forged a lie against me: With my whole heart will I keep thy precepts.<br>
<br>
119:70 Their heart is as fat as grease; But I delight in thy law.<br>
<br>
119:71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; That I may learn thy statutes.<br>
<br>
119:72 The law of thy mouth is better unto me Than thousands of gold and silver.<br>
<br>
119:73 YODH. Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: Give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.<br>
<br>
119:74 They that fear thee shall see me and be glad, Because I have hoped in thy word.<br>
<br>
119:75 I know, O Jehovah, that thy judgments are righteous, And that in faithfulness thou hast afflicted me.<br>
<br>
119:76 Let, I pray thee, thy lovingkindness be for my comfort, According to thy word unto thy servant.<br>
<br>
119:77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live; For thy law is my delight.<br>
<br>
119:78 Let the proud be put to shame; For they have overthrown me wrongfully: `But' I will meditate on thy precepts.<br>
<br>
119:79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me; And they shall know thy testimonies.<br>
<br>
119:80 Let my heart be perfect in thy statutes, That I be not put to shame.<br>
<br>
119:81 KAPH. My soul fainteth for thy salvation; `But' I hope in thy word.<br>
<br>
119:82 Mine eyes fail for thy word, While I say, When wilt thou comfort me?<br>
<br>
119:83 For I am become like a wine-skin in the smoke; Yet do I not forget thy statutes.<br>
<br>
119:84 How many are the days of thy servant? When wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?<br>
<br>
119:85 The proud have digged pits for me, Who are not according to thy law.<br>
<br>
119:86 All thy commandments are faithful: They persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.<br>
<br>
119:87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; But I forsook not thy precepts.<br>
<br>
119:88 LAMEDH. Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; So shall I observe the testimony of thy mouth.<br>
<br>
119:89 For ever, O Jehovah, Thy word is settled in heaven.<br>
<br>
119:90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: Thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.<br>
<br>
119:91 They abide this day according to thine ordinances; For all things are thy servants.<br>
<br>
119:92 Unless thy law had been my delight, I should then have perished in mine affliction.<br>
<br>
119:93 I will never forget thy precepts; For with them thou hast quickened me.<br>
<br>
119:94 I am thine, save me; For I have sought thy precepts.<br>
<br>
119:95 The wicked have waited for me, to destroy me; `But' I will consider thy testimonies.<br>
<br>
119:96 MEM. I have seen an end of all perfection; `But' thy commandment is exceeding broad.<br>
<br>
119:97 Oh how love I thy law! It is my meditation all the day.<br>
<br>
119:98 Thy commandments make me wiser than mine enemies; For they are ever with me.<br>
<br>
119:99 I have more understanding than all my teachers; For thy testimonies are my meditation.<br>
<br>
119:100 I understand more than the aged, Because I have kept thy precepts.<br>
<br>
119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, That I might observe thy word.<br>
<br>
119:102 I have not turned aside from thine ordinances; For thou hast taught me.<br>
<br>
119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! `Yea, sweeter' than honey to my mouth!<br>
<br>
119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: Therefore I hate every false way.<br>
<br>
119:105 NUN. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, And light unto my path.<br>
<br>
119:106 I have sworn, and have confirmed it, That I will observe thy righteous ordinances.<br>
<br>
119:107 I am afflicted very much: Quicken me, O Jehovah, according unto thy word.<br>
<br>
119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill-offerings of my mouth, O Jehovah, And teach me thine ordinances.<br>
<br>
119:109 My soul is continually in my hand; Yet do I not forget thy law.<br>
<br>
119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me; Yet have I not gone astray from thy precepts.<br>
<br>
119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as a heritage for ever; For they are the rejoicing of my heart.<br>
<br>
119:112 I have inclined my heart to perform thy statutes For ever, even unto the end.<br>
<br>
119:113 SAMEKH. I hate them that are of a double mind; But thy law do I love.<br>
<br>
119:114 Thou art my hiding-place and my shield: I hope in thy word.<br>
<br>
119:115 Depart from me, ye evil-doers, That I may keep the commandments of my God.<br>
<br>
119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live; And let me not be ashamed of my hope.<br>
<br>
119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe, And shall have respect unto thy statutes continually.<br>
<br>
119:118 Thou hast set at nought all them that err from thy statutes; For their deceit is falsehood.<br>
<br>
119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: Therefore I love thy testimonies.<br>
<br>
119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; And I am afraid of thy judgments.<br>
<br>
119:121 AYIN. I have done justice and righteousness: Leave me not to mine oppressors.<br>
<br>
119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: Let not the proud oppress me.<br>
<br>
119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, And for thy righteous word.<br>
<br>
119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy lovingkindness, And teach me thy statutes.<br>
<br>
119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, That I may know thy testimonies.<br>
<br>
119:126 It is time for Jehovah to work; `For' they have made void thy law.<br>
<br>
119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments Above gold, yea, above fine gold.<br>
<br>
119:128 Therefore I esteem all `thy' precepts concerning all `things' to be right; `And' I hate every false way.<br>
<br>
119:129 PE. Thy testimonies are wonderful; Therefore doth my soul keep them.<br>
<br>
119:130 The opening of thy words giveth light; It giveth understanding unto the simple.<br>
<br>
119:131 I opened wide my mouth, and panted; For I longed for thy commandments.<br>
<br>
119:132 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me, As thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.<br>
<br>
119:133 Establish my footsteps in thy word; And let not any iniquity have dominion over me.<br>
<br>
119:134 Redeem me from the oppression of man: So will I observe thy precepts.<br>
<br>
119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; And teach me thy statutes.<br>
<br>
119:136 Streams of water run down mine eyes, Because they observe not thy law.<br>
<br>
119:137 TSADHE. Righteous art thou, O Jehovah, And upright are thy judgments.<br>
<br>
119:138 Thou hast commanded thy testimonies in righteousness And very faithfulness.<br>
<br>
119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, Because mine adversaries have forgotten thy words.<br>
<br>
119:140 Thy word is very pure; Therefore thy servant loveth it.<br>
<br>
119:141 I am small and despised; `Yet' do I not forget thy precepts.<br>
<br>
119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, And thy law is truth.<br>
<br>
119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me; `Yet' thy commandments are my delight.<br>
<br>
119:144 Thy testimonies are righteous for ever: Give me understanding, and I shall live.<br>
<br>
119:145 QOPH. I have called with my whole heart; answer me, O Jehovah: I will keep thy statutes.<br>
<br>
119:146 I have called unto thee; save me, And I shall observe thy testimonies.<br>
<br>
119:147 I anticipated the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy words.<br>
<br>
119:148 Mine eyes anticipated the night-watches, That I might meditate on thy word.<br>
<br>
119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: Quicken me, O Jehovah, according to thine ordinances.<br>
<br>
119:150 They draw nigh that follow after wickedness; They are far from thy law.<br>
<br>
119:151 Thou art nigh, O Jehovah; And all thy commandments are truth.<br>
<br>
119:152 Of old have I known from thy testimonies, That thou hast founded them for ever.<br>
<br>
119:153 RESH. Consider mine affliction, and deliver me; For I do not forget thy law.<br>
<br>
119:154 Plead thou my cause, and redeem me: Quicken me according to thy word.<br>
<br>
119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked; For they seek not thy statutes.<br>
<br>
119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O Jehovah: Quicken me according to thine ordinances.<br>
<br>
119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine adversaries; `Yet' have I not swerved from thy testimonies.<br>
<br>
119:158 I beheld the treacherous, and was grieved, Because they observe not thy word.<br>
<br>
119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: Quicken me, O Jehovah, according to thy lovingkindness.<br>
<br>
119:160 The sum of thy word is truth; And every one of thy righteous ordinances `endureth' for ever.<br>
<br>
119:161 SHIN. Princes have persecuted me without a cause; But my heart standeth in awe of thy words.<br>
<br>
119:162 I rejoice at thy word, As one that findeth great spoil.<br>
<br>
119:163 I hate and abhor falsehood; `But' thy law do I love.<br>
<br>
119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee, Because of thy righteous ordinances.<br>
<br>
119:165 Great peace have they that love thy law; And they have no occasion of stumbling.<br>
<br>
119:166 I have hoped for thy salvation, O Jehovah, And have done thy commandments.<br>
<br>
119:167 My soul hath observed thy testimonies; And I love them exceedingly.<br>
<br>
119:168 I have observed thy precepts and thy testimonies; For all my ways are before thee.<br>
<br>
119:169 TAV. Let my cry come near before thee, O Jehovah: Give me understanding according to thy word.<br>
<br>
119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: Deliver me according to thy word.<br>
<br>
119:171 Let my lips utter praise; For thou teachest me thy statutes.<br>
<br>
119:172 Let my tongue sing of thy word; For all thy commandments are righteousness.<br>
<br>
119:173 Let thy hand be ready to help me; For I have chosen thy precepts.<br>
<br>
119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O Jehovah; And thy law is my delight.<br>
<br>
119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; And let thine ordinances help me.<br>
<br>
119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; Seek thy servant; For I do not forget thy commandments. Psalm 120 A Song of Ascents.<br>
