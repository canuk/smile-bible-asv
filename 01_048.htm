<blockquote>
48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.<br>
<br>
48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.<br>
<br>
48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,<br>
<br>
48:4 and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.<br>
<br>
48:5 And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine.<br>
<br>
48:6 And thy issue, that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.<br>
<br>
48:7 And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).<br>
<br>
48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?<br>
<br>
48:9 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.<br>
<br>
48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.<br>
<br>
48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath let me see thy seed also.<br>
<br>
48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.<br>
<br>
48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.<br>
<br>
48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born.<br>
<br>
48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who hath fed me all my life long unto this day,<br>
<br>
48:16 the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.<br>
<br>
48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.<br>
<br>
48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.<br>
<br>
48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know `it', my son, I know `it'. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.<br>
<br>
48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.<br>
<br>
48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God will be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.<br>
<br>
48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.<br>
