<br>
27:2 Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.<br>
<br>
27:3 `He was' of the children of Perez, the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month.<br>
<br>
27:4 And over the course of the second month was Dodai the Ahohite, and his course; and Mikloth the ruler: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.<br>
<br>
27:5 The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada the priest, chief: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.<br>
<br>
27:6 This is that Benaiah, who was the mighty man of the thirty, and over the thirty: and `of' his course was Ammizabad his son.<br>
<br>
27:7 The fourth `captain' for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.<br>

<br>
27:34 and after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the captain of the king's host was Joab.<br>
