<blockquote>
3:1 And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.<br>
<br>
3:2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.<br>
<br>
3:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.<br>
<br>
3:4 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.<br>
<br>
3:5 For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;<br>
<br>
3:6 not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.<br>
<br>
3:7 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.<br>
<br>
3:8 Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.<br>
<br>
3:9 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.<br>
<br>
3:10 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.<br>
<br>
3:11 And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.<br>
<br>
3:12 Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, `saying', Blessed be the glory of Jehovah from his place.<br>
<br>
3:13 And `I heard' the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.<br>
<br>
3:14 So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of Jehovah was strong upon me.<br>
<br>
3:15 Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.<br>
<br>
3:16 And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,<br>
<br>
3:17 Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.<br>
<br>
3:18 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.<br>
<br>
3:19 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.<br>
<br>
3:20 Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.<br>
<br>
3:21 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.<br>
<br>
3:22 And the hand of Jehovah was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.<br>
<br>
3:23 Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of Jehovah stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.<br>
<br>
3:24 Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.<br>
<br>
3:25 But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:<br>
<br>
3:26 and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.<br>
<br>
3:27 But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.<br>
