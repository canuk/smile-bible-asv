<blockquote>
3:1 I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.<br>
<br>
3:2 He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.<br>
<br>
3:3 Surely against me he turneth his hand again and again all the day.<br>
<br>
3:4 My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.<br>
<br>
3:5 He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.<br>
<br>
3:6 He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.<br>
<br>
3:7 He hath walled me about, that I cannot go forth; he hath made my chain heavy.<br>
<br>
3:8 Yea, when I cry, and call for help, he shutteth out my prayer.<br>
<br>
3:9 He hath walled up my ways with hewn stone; he hath made my paths crooked.<br>
<br>
3:10 He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.<br>
<br>
3:11 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he hath made me desolate.<br>
<br>
3:12 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.<br>
<br>
3:13 He hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins.<br>
<br>
3:14 I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.<br>
<br>
3:15 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath sated me with wormwood.<br>
<br>
3:16 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he hath covered me with ashes.<br>
<br>
3:17 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace; I forgat prosperity.<br>
<br>
3:18 And I said, My strength is perished, and mine expectation from Jehovah.<br>
<br>
3:19 Remember mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.<br>
<br>
3:20 My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed down within me.<br>
<br>
3:21 This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope.<br>
<br>
3:22 `It is of' Jehovah's lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.<br>
<br>
3:23 They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness.<br>
<br>
3:24 Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.<br>
<br>
3:25 Jehovah is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.<br>
<br>
3:26 It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Jehovah.<br>
<br>
3:27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.<br>
<br>
3:28 Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he hath laid it upon him.<br>
<br>
3:29 Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.<br>
<br>
3:30 Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him; let him be filled full with reproach.<br>
<br>
3:31 For the Lord will not cast off for ever.<br>
<br>
3:32 For though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.<br>
<br>
3:33 For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.<br>
<br>
3:34 To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,<br>
<br>
3:35 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,<br>
<br>
3:36 To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.<br>
<br>
3:37 Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?<br>
<br>
3:38 Out of the mouth of the Most High cometh there not evil and good?<br>
<br>
3:39 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?<br>
<br>
3:40 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Jehovah.<br>
<br>
3:41 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.<br>
<br>
3:42 We have transgressed and have rebelled; thou hast not pardoned.<br>
<br>
3:43 Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.<br>
<br>
3:44 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.<br>
<br>
3:45 Thou hast made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.<br>
<br>
3:46 All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.<br>
<br>
3:47 Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and destruction.<br>
<br>
3:48 Mine eye runneth down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.<br>
<br>
3:49 Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,<br>
<br>
3:50 Till Jehovah look down, and behold from heaven.<br>
<br>
3:51 Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.<br>
<br>
3:52 They have chased me sore like a bird, they that are mine enemies without cause.<br>
<br>
3:53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me.<br>
<br>
3:54 Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.<br>
<br>
3:55 I called upon thy name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest dungeon.<br>
<br>
3:56 Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.<br>
<br>
3:57 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not.<br>
<br>
3:58 O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.<br>
<br>
3:59 O Jehovah, thou hast seen my wrong; judge thou my cause.<br>
<br>
3:60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.<br>
<br>
3:61 Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, and all their devices against me,<br>
<br>
3:62 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.<br>
<br>
3:63 Behold thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.<br>
<br>
3:64 Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.<br>
<br>
3:65 Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, thy curse unto them.<br>
<br>
3:66 Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah.<br>
<br>
