<blockquote>
5:1 Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;<br>
<br>
5:2 and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell.<br>
<br>
5:3 But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints;<br>
<br>
5:4 nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks.<br>
<br>
5:5 For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.<br>
<br>
5:6 Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.<br>
<br>
5:7 Be not ye therefore partakers with them;<br>
<br>
5:8 For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light<br>
<br>
5:9 (for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),<br>
<br>
5:10 proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord;<br>
<br>
5:11 and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them;<br>
<br>
5:12 for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.<br>
<br>
5:13 But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light.<br>
<br>
5:14 Wherefore `he' saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee.<br>
<br>
5:15 Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise;<br>
<br>
5:16 redeeming the time, because the days are evil.<br>
<br>
5:17 Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.<br>
<br>
5:18 And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit;<br>
<br>
5:19 speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;<br>
<br>
5:20 giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;<br>
<br>
5:21 subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.<br>
<br>
5:22 Wives, `be in subjection' unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.<br>
<br>
5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the church, `being' himself the saviour of the body.<br>
<br>
5:24 But as the church is subject to Christ, so `let' the wives also `be' to their husbands in everything.<br>
<br>
5:25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;<br>
<br>
5:26 that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,<br>
<br>
5:27 that he might present the church to himself a glorious `church', not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.<br>
<br>
5:28 Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself:<br>
<br>
5:29 for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church;<br>
<br>
5:30 because we are members of his body.<br>
<br>
5:31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.<br>
<br>
5:32 This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.<br>
<br>
5:33 Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and `let' the wife `see' that she fear her husband.<br>
