<blockquote>
2:1 And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.<br>
<br>
2:2 And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.<br>
<br>
2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.<br>
<br>
2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that Jehovah God made earth and heaven.<br>
<br>
2:5 And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;<br>
<br>
2:6 but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.<br>
<br>
2:7 And Jehovah God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.<br>
<br>
2:8 And Jehovah God planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.<br>
<br>
2:9 And out of the ground made Jehovah God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.<br>
<br>
2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.<br>
<br>
2:11 The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;<br>
<br>
2:12 and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.<br>
<br>
2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.<br>
<br>
2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.<br>
<br>
2:15 And Jehovah God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.<br>
<br>
2:16 And Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:<br>
<br>
2:17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.<br>
<br>
2:18 And Jehovah God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.<br>
<br>
2:19 And out of the ground Jehovah God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.<br>
<br>
2:20 And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.<br>
<br>
2:21 And Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof:<br>
<br>
2:22 and the rib, which Jehovah God had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.<br>
<br>
2:23 And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.<br>
<br>
2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.<br>
<br>
2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.<br>
