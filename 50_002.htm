<blockquote>
2:1 If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions,<br>
<br>
2:2 make full my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;<br>
<br>
2:3 `doing' nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself;<br>
<br>
2:4 not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.<br>
<br>
2:5 Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:<br>
<br>
2:6 who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped,<br>
<br>
2:7 but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men;<br>
<br>
2:8 and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient `even' unto death, yea, the death of the cross.<br>
<br>
2:9 Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name;<br>
<br>
2:10 that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of `things' in heaven and `things' on earth and `things' under the earth,<br>
<br>
2:11 and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.<br>
<br>
2:12 So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;<br>
<br>
2:13 for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.<br>
<br>
2:14 Do all things without murmurings and questionings:<br>
<br>
2:15 that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world,<br>
<br>
2:16 holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain.<br>
<br>
2:17 Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all:<br>
<br>
2:18 and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me.<br>
<br>
2:19 But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.<br>
<br>
2:20 For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.<br>
<br>
2:21 For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
2:22 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child `serveth' a father, `so' he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.<br>
<br>
2:23 Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:<br>
<br>
2:24 but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly.<br>
<br>
2:25 But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;<br>
<br>
2:26 since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick:<br>
<br>
2:27 for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.<br>
<br>
2:28 I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.<br>
<br>
2:29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:<br>
<br>
2:30 because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.<br>
