<blockquote>
13:1 On that day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea side.<br>
<br>
13:2 And there were gathered unto him great multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach.<br>
<br>
13:3 And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow;<br>
<br>
13:4 and as he sowed, some `seeds' fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them:<br>
<br>
13:5 and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth:<br>
<br>
13:6 and when the sun was risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.<br>
<br>
13:7 And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them:<br>
<br>
13:8 and others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.<br>
<br>
13:9 He that hath ears, let him hear.<br>
<br>
13:10 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables?<br>
<br>
13:11 And he answered and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.<br>
<br>
13:12 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.<br>
<br>
13:13 Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.<br>
<br>
13:14 And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:<br>
<br>
13:15 For this people's heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.<br>
<br>
13:16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.<br>
<br>
13:17 For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.<br>
<br>
13:18 Hear then ye the parable of the sower.<br>
<br>
13:19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, `then' cometh the evil `one', and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart. This is he that was sown by the way side.<br>
<br>
13:20 And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it;<br>
<br>
13:21 yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth.<br>
<br>
13:22 And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.<br>
<br>
13:23 And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.<br>
<br>
13:24 Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field:<br>
<br>
13:25 but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.<br>
<br>
13:26 But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.<br>
<br>
13:27 And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares?<br>
<br>
13:28 And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this. And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?<br>
<br>
13:29 But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.<br>
<br>
13:30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.<br>
<br>
13:31 Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:<br>
<br>
13:32 which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.<br>
<br>
13:33 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.<br>
<br>
13:34 All these things spake Jesus in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spake he nothing unto them:<br>
<br>
13:35 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.<br>
<br>
13:36 Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.<br>
<br>
13:37 And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;<br>
<br>
13:38 and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil `one';<br>
<br>
13:39 and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.<br>
<br>
13:40 As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.<br>
<br>
13:41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity,<br>
<br>
13:42 and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.<br>
<br>
13:43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that hath ears, let him hear.<br>
<br>
13:44 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.<br>
<br>
13:45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls:<br>
<br>
13:46 and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.<br>
<br>
13:47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:<br>
<br>
13:48 which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away.<br>
<br>
13:49 So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous,<br>
<br>
13:50 and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.<br>
<br>
13:51 Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.<br>
<br>
13:52 And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.<br>
<br>
13:53 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed thence.<br>
<br>
13:54 And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?<br>
<br>
13:55 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas?<br>
<br>
13:56 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?<br>
<br>
13:57 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.<br>
<br>
13:58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.<br>
