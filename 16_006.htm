<blockquote>
6:1 Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)<br>
<br>
6:2 that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in `one of' the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.<br>
<br>
6:3 And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?<br>
<br>
6:4 And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.<br>
<br>
6:5 Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,<br>
<br>
6:6 wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou art building the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words.<br>
<br>
6:7 And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.<br>
<br>
6:8 Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.<br>
<br>
6:9 For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, `O God', strengthen thou my hands.<br>
<br>
6:10 And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.<br>
<br>
6:11 And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.<br>
<br>
6:12 And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.<br>
<br>
6:13 For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.<br>
<br>
6:14 Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.<br>
<br>
6:15 So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth `day' of `the month' Elul, in fifty and two days.<br>
<br>
6:16 And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard `thereof', that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.<br>
<br>
6:17 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and `the letters' of Tobiah came unto them.<br>
<br>
6:18 For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.<br>
<br>
6:19 Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. `And' Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.<br>
