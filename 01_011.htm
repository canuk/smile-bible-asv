<blockquote>
11:1 And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.<br>
<br>
11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.<br>
<br>
11:3 And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.<br>
<br>
11:4 And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top `may reach' unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.<br>
<br>
11:5 And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.<br>
<br>
11:6 And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.<br>
<br>
11:7 Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.<br>
<br>
11:8 So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.<br>
<br>
11:9 Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.<br>
<br>
11:10 These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood.<br>
<br>
11:11 and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
<br>
11:12 And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah.<br>
<br>
11:13 and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
<br>
11:14 And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:<br>
<br>
11:15 and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
<br>
11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:<br>
<br>
11:17 and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
<br>
11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:<br>
<br>
11:19 and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
<br>
11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:<br>
<br>
11:21 and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
<br>
11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:<br>
<br>
11:23 and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
<br>
11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:<br>
<br>
11:25 and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.<br>
<br>
11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.<br>
<br>
11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begat Lot.<br>
<br>
11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.<br>
<br>
11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: The name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.<br>
<br>
11:30 And Sarai was barren; She had no child.<br>
<br>
11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.<br>
<br>
11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.<br>
