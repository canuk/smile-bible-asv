<blockquote>
11:1 I say then, Did God cast off his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.<br>
<br>
11:2 God did not cast off his people which he foreknew. Or know ye not what the scripture saith of Elijah? how he pleadeth with God against Israel:<br>
<br>
11:3 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.<br>
<br>
11:4 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.<br>
<br>
11:5 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.<br>
<br>
11:6 But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.<br>
<br>
11:7 What then? that which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened:<br>
<br>
11:8 according as it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day.<br>
<br>
11:9 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:<br>
<br>
11:10 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, And bow thou down their back always.<br>
<br>
11:11 I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? God forbid: but by their fall salvation `is come' unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.<br>
<br>
11:12 Now if their fall, is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?<br>
<br>
11:13 But I speak to you that are Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;<br>
<br>
11:14 if by any means I may provoke to jealousy `them that are' my flesh, and may save some of them.<br>
<br>
11:15 For if the casting away of them `is' the reconciling of the world, what `shall' the receiving `of them be', but life from the dead?<br>
<br>
11:16 And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.<br>
<br>
11:17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree;<br>
<br>
11:18 glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee.<br>
<br>
11:19 Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.<br>
<br>
11:20 Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith. Be not highminded, but fear:<br>
<br>
11:21 for if God spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.<br>
<br>
11:22 Behold then the goodness and severity of God: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, God's goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.<br>
<br>
11:23 And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.<br>
<br>
11:24 For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural `branches', be grafted into their own olive tree?<br>
<br>
11:25 For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in;<br>
<br>
11:26 and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written, There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer; He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:<br>
<br>
11:27 And this is my covenant unto them, When I shall take away their sins.<br>
<br>
11:28 As touching the gospel, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sake.<br>
<br>
11:29 For the gifts and the calling of God are not repented of.<br>
<br>
11:30 For as ye in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,<br>
<br>
11:31 even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.<br>
<br>
11:32 For God hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.<br>
<br>
11:33 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!<br>
<br>
11:34 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?<br>
<br>
11:35 or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?<br>
<br>
11:36 For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things. To him `be' the glory for ever. Amen.<br>
