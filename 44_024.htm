<blockquote>
24:1 And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and `with' an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.<br>
<br>
24:2 And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by the providence evils are corrected for this nation,<br>
<br>
24:3 we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.<br>
<br>
24:4 But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words.<br>
<br>
24:5 For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:<br>
<br>
24:6 who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold: `and we would have judged him according to our law.'<br>
<br>
24:7 `But the chief captain Lysias came, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,'<br>
<br>
24:8 `commanding his accusers to come before thee.' from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.<br>
<br>
24:9 And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.<br>
<br>
24:10 And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defense:<br>
<br>
24:11 Seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:<br>
<br>
24:12 and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.<br>
<br>
24:13 Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.<br>
<br>
24:14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets;<br>
<br>
24:15 having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust.<br>
<br>
24:16 Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.<br>
<br>
24:17 Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:<br>
<br>
24:18 amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but `there were' certain Jews from Asia--<br>
<br>
24:19 who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me.<br>
<br>
24:20 Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council,<br>
<br>
24:21 except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.<br>
<br>
24:22 But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.<br>
<br>
24:23 And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.<br>
<br>
24:24 But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
24:25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.<br>
<br>
24:26 He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.<br>
<br>
24:27 But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.<br>
