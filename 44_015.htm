<blockquote>
15:1 And certain men came down from Judaea and taught the brethren, `saying', Except ye be circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved.<br>
<br>
15:2 And when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and questioning with them, `the brethren' appointed that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.<br>
<br>
15:3 They therefore, being brought on their way by the church, passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.<br>
<br>
15:4 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church and the apostles and the elders, and they rehearsed all things that God had done with them.<br>
<br>
15:5 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying, It is needful to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.<br>
<br>
15:6 And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider of this matter.<br>
<br>
15:7 And when there had been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them, Brethren, ye know that a good while ago God made choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.<br>
<br>
15:8 And God, who knoweth the heart, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did unto us;<br>
<br>
15:9 and he made no distinction between us and them, cleansing their hearts by faith.<br>
<br>
15:10 Now therefore why make ye trial of God, that ye should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?<br>
<br>
15:11 But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in like manner as they.<br>
<br>
15:12 And all the multitude kept silence; and they hearkened unto Barnabas and Paul rehearsing what signs and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles through them.<br>
<br>
15:13 And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me:<br>
<br>
15:14 Symeon hath rehearsed how first God visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.<br>
<br>
15:15 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,<br>
<br>
15:16 After these things I will return, And I will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen; And I will build again the ruins thereof, And I will set it up:<br>
<br>
15:17 That the residue of men may seek after the Lord, And all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called,<br>
<br>
15:18 Saith the Lord, who maketh these things known from of old.<br>
<br>
15:19 Wherefore my judgment is, that we trouble not them that from among the Gentiles turn to God;<br>
<br>
15:20 but that we write unto them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.<br>
<br>
15:21 For Moses from generations of old hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath.<br>
<br>
15:22 Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men out of their company, and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; `namely', Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:<br>
<br>
15:23 and they wrote `thus' by them, The apostles and the elders, brethren, unto the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greeting:<br>
<br>
15:24 Forasmuch as we have heard that certain who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls; to whom we gave no commandment;<br>
<br>
15:25 it seemed good unto us, having come to one accord, to choose out men and send them unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,<br>
<br>
15:26 men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>
<br>
15:27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who themselves also shall tell you the same things by word of mouth.<br>
<br>
15:28 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:<br>
<br>
15:29 that ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.<br>
<br>
15:30 So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle.<br>
<br>
15:31 And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation.<br>
<br>
15:32 And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.<br>
<br>
15:33 And after they had spent some time `there', they were dismissed in peace from the brethren unto those that had sent them forth.<br>
<br>
15:34 `But it seemed good unto Silas to abide there.'<br>
<br>
15:35 But Paul and Barnabas tarried in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.<br>
<br>
15:36 And after some days Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city wherein we proclaimed the word of the Lord, `and see' how they fare.<br>
<br>
15:37 And Barnabas was minded to take with them John also, who was called Mark.<br>
<br>
15:38 But Paul thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.<br>
<br>
15:39 And there arose a sharp contention, so that they parted asunder one from the other, and Barnabas took Mark with him, and sailed away unto Cyprus;<br>
<br>
15:40 but Paul choose Silas, and went forth, being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord.<br>
<br>
15:41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.<br>
