<blockquote>
40:1 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth `day' of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he brought me thither.<br>
<br>
40:2 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel, and set me down upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the frame of a city on the south.<br>
<br>
40:3 And he brought me thither; and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.<br>
<br>
40:4 And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thy heart upon all that I shall show thee; for, to the intent that I may show them unto thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to the house of Israel.<br>
<br>
40:5 And, behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about, and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long, of a cubit and a handbreadth each: so he measured the thickness of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.<br>
<br>
40:6 Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and went up the steps thereof: and he measured the threshold of the gate, one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.<br>
<br>
40:7 And every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad; and `the space' between the lodges was five cubits; and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward the house was one reed.<br>
<br>
40:8 He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.<br>
<br>
40:9 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was toward the house.<br>
<br>
40:10 And the lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side, and three on that side; they three were of one measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.<br>
<br>
40:11 And he measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;<br>
<br>
40:12 and a border before the lodges, one cubit `on this side', and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges, six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.<br>
<br>
40:13 And he measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to the roof of the other, a breadth of five and twenty cubits; door against door.<br>
<br>
40:14 He made also posts, threescore cubits; and the court `reached' unto the posts, round about the gate.<br>
<br>
40:15 And `from' the forefront of the gate at the entrance unto the forefront of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.<br>
<br>
40:16 And there were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches; and windows were round about inward; and upon `each' post were palm-trees.<br>
<br>
40:17 Then brought he me into the outer court; and, lo, there were chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about: thirty chambers were upon the pavement.<br>
<br>
40:18 And the pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable unto the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.<br>
<br>
40:19 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, a hundred cubits, `both' on the east and on the north.<br>
<br>
40:20 And the gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof.<br>
<br>
40:21 And the lodges thereof were three on this side and three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.<br>
<br>
40:22 And the windows thereof, and the arches thereof, and the palm-trees thereof, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect is toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches thereof were before them.<br>
<br>
40:23 And there was a gate to the inner court over against the `other' gate, `both' on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits.<br>
<br>
40:24 And he led me toward the south; and, behold, a gate toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures.<br>
<br>
40:25 And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.<br>
<br>
40:26 And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them; and it had palm-trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.<br>
<br>
40:27 And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south: and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits.<br>
<br>
40:28 Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he measured the south gate according to these measures;<br>
<br>
40:29 and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.<br>
<br>
40:30 And there were arches round about, five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad.<br>
<br>
40:31 And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof: and the ascent to it had eight steps.<br>
<br>
40:32 And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he measured the gate according to these measures;<br>
<br>
40:33 and the lodges thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round about; it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.<br>
<br>
40:34 And the arches thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.<br>
<br>
40:35 And he brought me to the north gate: and he measured `it' according to these measures;<br>
<br>
40:36 the lodges thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof: and there were windows therein round about; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.<br>
<br>
40:37 And the posts thereof were toward the outer court; and palm-trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the ascent to it had eight steps.<br>
<br>
40:38 And a chamber with the door thereof was by the posts at the gates; there they washed the burnt-offering.<br>
<br>
40:39 And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt-offering and the sin-offering and the trespass-offering.<br>
<br>
40:40 And on the `one' side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the gate toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side, which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.<br>
<br>
40:41 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew `the sacrifices'.<br>
<br>
40:42 And there were four tables for the burnt-offering, of hewn stone, a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt-offering and the sacrifice.<br>
<br>
40:43 And the hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about: and upon the tables was the flesh of the oblation.<br>
<br>
40:44 And without the inner gate were chambers for the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.<br>
<br>
40:45 And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;<br>
<br>
40:46 and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi come near to Jehovah to minister unto him.<br>
<br>
40:47 And he measured the court, a hundred cubits long, and a hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.<br>
<br>
40:48 Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side.<br>
<br>
40:49 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; even by the steps whereby they went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side, and another on that side.<br>
