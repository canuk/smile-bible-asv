<blockquote>
8:1 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.<br>
<br>
8:2 And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.<br>
<br>
8:3 But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and dragging men and women committed them to prison.<br>
<br>
8:4 They therefore that were scattered abroad, went about preaching the word.<br>
<br>
8:5 And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ.<br>
<br>
8:6 And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.<br>
<br>
8:7 For `from' many of those that had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed.<br>
<br>
8:8 And there was much joy in that city.<br>
<br>
8:9 But there was a certain man, Simon by name, who beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:<br>
<br>
8:10 to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great.<br>
<br>
8:11 And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.<br>
<br>
8:12 But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.<br>
<br>
8:13 And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed.<br>
<br>
8:14 Now when the apostles that were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:<br>
<br>
8:15 who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit:<br>
<br>
8:16 for as yet it was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.<br>
<br>
8:17 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
8:18 Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,<br>
<br>
8:19 saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.<br>
<br>
8:20 But Peter said unto him, Thy silver perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money.<br>
<br>
8:21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God.<br>
<br>
8:22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee.<br>
<br>
8:23 For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.<br>
<br>
8:24 And Simon answered and said, Pray ye for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me.<br>
<br>
8:25 They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.<br>
<br>
8:26 But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert.<br>
<br>
8:27 And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem to worship;<br>
<br>
8:28 and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.<br>
<br>
8:29 And the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.<br>
<br>
8:30 And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?<br>
<br>
8:31 And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him.<br>
<br>
8:32 Now the passage of the Scripture which he was reading was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, So he openeth not his mouth:<br>
<br>
8:33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: His generation who shall declare? For his life is taken from the earth.<br>
<br>
8:34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other?<br>
<br>
8:35 And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached unto him Jesus.<br>
<br>
8:36 And as they went on the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, `here is' water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?<br>
<br>
8:37 `And Philip said, If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.'<br>
<br>
8:38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.<br>
<br>
8:39 And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.<br>
<br>
8:40 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.<br>
