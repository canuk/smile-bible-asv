<blockquote>
13:1 And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah; and Jehovah delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.<br>
<br>
13:2 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.<br>
<br>
13:3 And the angel of Jehovah appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.<br>
<br>
13:4 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:<br>
<br>
13:5 for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.<br>
<br>
13:6 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of God, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name:<br>
<br>
13:7 but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God from the womb to the day of his death.<br>
<br>
13:8 Then Manoah entreated Jehovah, and said, Oh, Lord, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.<br>
<br>
13:9 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.<br>
<br>
13:10 And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the `other' day.<br>
<br>
13:11 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And he said, I am.<br>
<br>
13:12 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass: what shall be the ordering of the child, and `how' shall we do unto him?<br>
<br>
13:13 And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.<br>
<br>
13:14 She may not eat of anything that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.<br>
<br>
13:15 And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.<br>
<br>
13:16 And the angel of Jehovah said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of Jehovah.<br>
<br>
13:17 And Manoah said unto the angel of Jehovah, What is thy name, that, when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor?<br>
<br>
13:18 And the angel of Jehovah said unto him, Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful?<br>
<br>
13:19 So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto Jehovah: and `the angel' did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.<br>
<br>
13:20 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of Jehovah ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.<br>
<br>
13:21 But the angel of Jehovah did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Jehovah.<br>
<br>
13:22 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.<br>
<br>
13:23 But his wife said unto him, If Jehovah were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.<br>
<br>
13:24 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and Jehovah blessed him.<br>
<br>
13:25 And the Spirit of Jehovah began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.<br>
