<blockquote>
32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.<br>
<br>
32:2 And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.<br>
<br>
32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.<br>
<br>
32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:<br>
<br>
32:5 and I have oxen, and asses, `and' flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.<br>
<br>
32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.<br>
<br>
32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;<br>
<br>
32:8 and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.<br>
<br>
32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:<br>
<br>
32:10 I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.<br>
<br>
32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.<br>
<br>
32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.<br>
<br>
32:13 And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother:<br>
<br>
32:14 two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,<br>
<br>
32:15 thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.<br>
<br>
32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.<br>
<br>
32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?<br>
<br>
32:18 then thou shalt say `They are' thy servant Jacob's; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.<br>
<br>
32:19 And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;<br>
<br>
32:20 and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.<br>
<br>
32:21 So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.<br>
<br>
32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.<br>
<br>
32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.<br>
<br>
32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.<br>
<br>
32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.<br>
<br>
32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.<br>
<br>
32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.<br>
<br>
32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.<br>
<br>
32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.<br>
<br>
32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, `said he', I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.<br>
<br>
32:31 And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.<br>
<br>
32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip.<br>
