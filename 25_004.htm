<blockquote>
4:1 How is the gold become dim! `how' is the most pure gold changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.<br>
<br>
4:2 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!<br>
<br>
4:3 Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: The daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.<br>
<br>
4:4 The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: The young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.<br>
<br>
4:5 They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: They that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.<br>
<br>
4:6 For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid upon her.<br>
<br>
4:7 Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire.<br>
<br>
4:8 Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: Their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.<br>
<br>
4:9 They that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger; For these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field.<br>
<br>
4:10 The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.<br>
<br>
4:11 Jehovah hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger; And he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof.<br>
<br>
4:12 The kings of the earth believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
4:13 `It is' because of the sins of her prophets, `and' the iniquities of her priests, That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.<br>
<br>
4:14 They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood, So that men cannot touch their garments.<br>
<br>
4:15 Depart ye, they cried unto them, Unclean! depart, depart, touch not! When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn `here'.<br>
<br>
4:16 The anger of Jehovah hath scattered them; he will no more regard them: They respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.<br>
<br>
4:17 Our eyes do yet fail `in looking' for our vain help: In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.<br>
<br>
4:18 They hunt our steps, so that we cannot go in our streets: Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.<br>
<br>
4:19 Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens: They chased us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.<br>
<br>
4:20 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits; Of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.<br>
<br>
4:21 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz: The cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.<br>
<br>
4:22 The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will uncover thy sins.<br>
