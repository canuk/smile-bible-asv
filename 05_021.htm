<blockquote>
21:1 If one be found slain in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him;<br>
<br>
21:2 then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:<br>
<br>
21:3 and it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;<br>
<br>
21:4 and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley.<br>
<br>
21:5 And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Jehovah thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of Jehovah; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be.<br>
<br>
21:6 And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley;<br>
<br>
21:7 and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.<br>
<br>
21:8 Forgive, O Jehovah, thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood `to remain' in the midst of thy people Israel. And the blood shall be forgiven them.<br>
<br>
21:9 So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of Jehovah.<br>
<br>
21:10 When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and Jehovah thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive,<br>
<br>
21:11 and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife;<br>
<br>
21:12 then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;<br>
<br>
21:13 and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.<br>
<br>
21:14 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her.<br>
<br>
21:15 If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated;<br>
<br>
21:16 then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born:<br>
<br>
21:17 but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the first-born is his.<br>
<br>
21:18 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them;<br>
<br>
21:19 then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;<br>
<br>
21:20 and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.<br>
<br>
21:21 And all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.<br>
<br>
21:22 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree;<br>
<br>
21:23 his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is accursed of God; that thou defile not thy land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.<br>
