<blockquote>
15:1 Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying,<br>
<br>
15:2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.<br>
<br>
15:3 And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?<br>
<br>
15:4 For God said, Honor thy father and thy mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death.<br>
<br>
15:5 But ye say, whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given `to God';<br>
<br>
15:6 he shall not honor his father. And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition.<br>
<br>
15:7 Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,<br>
<br>
15:8 This people honoreth me with their lips; But their heart is far from me.<br>
<br>
15:9 But in vain do they worship me, Teaching `as their' doctrines the precepts of men.<br>
<br>
15:10 And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:<br>
<br>
15:11 Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man.<br>
<br>
15:12 Then came the disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?<br>
<br>
15:13 But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up.<br>
<br>
15:14 Let them alone: they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit.<br>
<br>
15:15 And Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us the parable.<br>
<br>
15:16 And he said, Are ye also even yet without understanding?<br>
<br>
15:17 Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?<br>
<br>
15:18 But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man.<br>
<br>
15:19 For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings:<br>
<br>
15:20 these are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.<br>
<br>
15:21 And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.<br>
<br>
15:22 And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a demon.<br>
<br>
15:23 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.<br>
<br>
15:24 But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<br>
<br>
15:25 But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.<br>
<br>
15:26 And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs.<br>
<br>
15:27 But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.<br>
<br>
15:28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.<br>
<br>
15:29 And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.<br>
<br>
15:30 And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at this feet; and he healed them:<br>
<br>
15:31 insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.<br>
<br>
15:32 And Jesus called unto him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint on the way.<br>
<br>
15:33 And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place as to fill so great a multitude?<br>
<br>
15:34 And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.<br>
<br>
15:35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;<br>
<br>
15:36 and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.<br>
<br>
15:37 And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.<br>
<br>
15:38 And they that did eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.<br>
<br>
15:39 And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.<br>
