<blockquote>
40:1 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.<br>
<br>
40:2 Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem; and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she hath received of Jehovah's hand double for all her sins.<br>
<br>
40:3 The voice of one that crieth, Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of Jehovah; make level in the desert a highway for our God.<br>
<br>
40:4 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the uneven shall be made level, and the rough places a plain:<br>
<br>
40:5 and the glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.<br>
<br>
40:6 The voice of one saying, Cry. And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.<br>
<br>
40:7 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the breath of Jehovah bloweth upon it; surely the people is grass.<br>
<br>
40:8 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our God shall stand forever.<br>
<br>
40:9 O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up on a high mountain; O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, your God!<br>
<br>
40:10 Behold, the Lord Jehovah will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him: Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.<br>
<br>
40:11 He will feed his flock like a shepherd, he will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, `and' will gently lead those that have their young.<br>
<br>
40:12 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?<br>
<br>
40:13 Who hath directed the Spirit of Jehovah, or being his counsellor hath taught him?<br>
<br>
40:14 With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?<br>
<br>
40:15 Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance: Behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.<br>
<br>
40:16 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering.<br>
<br>
40:17 All the nations are as nothing before him; they are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity.<br>
<br>
40:18 To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?<br>
<br>
40:19 The image, a workman hath cast `it', and the goldsmith overlayeth it with gold, and casteth `for it' silver chains.<br>
<br>
40:20 He that is too impoverished for `such' an oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a skilful workman to set up a graven image, that shall not be moved.<br>
<br>
40:21 Have ye not known? have yet not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?<br>
<br>
40:22 `It is' he that sitteth above the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in;<br>
<br>
40:23 that bringeth princes to nothing; that maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.<br>
<br>
40:24 Yea, they have not been planted; yea, they have not been sown; yea, their stock hath not taken root in the earth: moreover he bloweth upon them, and they wither, and the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble.<br>
<br>
40:25 To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal `to him'? saith the Holy One.<br>
<br>
40:26 Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these, that bringeth out their host by number; he calleth them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and for that he is strong in power, not one is lacking.<br>
<br>
40:27 Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from Jehovah, and the justice `due' to me is passed away from my God?<br>
<br>
40:28 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? The everlasting God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary; there is no searching of his understanding.<br>
<br>
40:29 He giveth power to the faint; and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength.<br>
<br>
40:30 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:<br>
<br>
40:31 but they that wait for Jehovah shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint.<br>
<br>
