<blockquote>
3:1 O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified?<br>
<br>
3:2 This only would I learn from you. Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?<br>
<br>
3:3 Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh?<br>
<br>
3:4 Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain.<br>
<br>
3:5 He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, `doeth he it' by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?<br>
<br>
3:6 Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.<br>
<br>
3:7 Know therefore that they that are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.<br>
<br>
3:8 And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham, `saying,' In thee shall all the nations be blessed.<br>
<br>
3:9 So then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.<br>
<br>
3:10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.<br>
<br>
3:11 Now that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith;<br>
<br>
3:12 and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them.<br>
<br>
3:13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:<br>
<br>
3:14 that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.<br>
<br>
3:15 Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man's covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto.<br>
<br>
3:16 Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.<br>
<br>
3:17 Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.<br>
<br>
3:18 For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.<br>
<br>
3:19 What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; `and it was' ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.<br>
<br>
3:20 Now a mediator is not `a mediator' of one; but God is one.<br>
<br>
3:21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law.<br>
<br>
3:22 But the scriptures shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.<br>
<br>
3:23 But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.<br>
<br>
3:24 So that the law is become our tutor `to bring us' unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.<br>
<br>
3:25 But now faith that is come, we are no longer under a tutor.<br>
<br>
3:26 For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
3:27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.<br>
<br>
3:28 There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one `man' in Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
3:29 And if ye are Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise.<br>
<br>
