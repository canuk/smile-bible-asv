<blockquote>
4:1 And king Solomon was king over all Israel.<br>
<br>
4:2 And these were the princes whom he had: Azariah the son of Zadok, the priest;<br>
<br>
4:3 Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder;<br>
<br>
4:4 and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests;<br>
<br>
4:5 and Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; and Zabud the son of Nathan was chief minister, `and' the king's friend;<br>
<br>
4:6 and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda was over the men subject to taskwork.<br>
<br>
4:7 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided victuals for the king and his household: each man had to make provision for a month in the year.<br>
<br>
4:8 And these are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill-country of Ephraim;<br>
<br>
4:9 Ben-deker, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;<br>
<br>
4:10 Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him `pertained' Socoh, and all the land of Hepher);<br>
<br>
4:11 Ben-abinadab, in all the height of Dor (he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife);<br>
<br>
4:12 Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan, beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as beyond Jokmeam;<br>
<br>
4:13 Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (to him `pertained' the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; `even' to him `pertained' the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls and brazen bars);<br>
<br>
4:14 Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;<br>
<br>
4:15 Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also took Basemath the daughter of Solomon to wife);<br>
<br>
4:16 Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;<br>
<br>
4:17 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar;<br>
<br>
4:18 Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin;<br>
<br>
4:19 Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and `he was' the only officer that was in the land.<br>
<br>
4:20 Judah and Israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.<br>
<br>
4:21 And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life.<br>
<br>
4:22 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,<br>
<br>
4:23 ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl.<br>
<br>
4:24 For he had dominion over all `the region' on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River: and he had peace on all sides round about him.<br>
<br>
4:25 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.<br>
<br>
4:26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.<br>
<br>
4:27 And those officers provided victuals for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking.<br>
<br>
4:28 Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where `the officers' were, every man according to his charge.<br>
<br>
4:29 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore.<br>
<br>
4:30 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.<br>
<br>
4:31 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all the nations round about.<br>
<br>
4:32 And he spake three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five.<br>
<br>
4:33 And he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spake also of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and of fishes.<br>
<br>
4:34 And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.<br>
