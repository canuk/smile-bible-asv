<blockquote>
9:1 And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.<br>
<br>
9:2 And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.<br>
<br>
9:3 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.<br>
<br>
9:4 And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.<br>
<br>
9:5 And as many as receive you not, when ye depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.<br>
<br>
9:6 And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.<br>
<br>
9:7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead;<br>
<br>
9:8 and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.<br>
<br>
9:9 And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.<br>
<br>
9:10 And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida.<br>
<br>
9:11 But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and them that had need of healing he cured.<br>
<br>
9:12 And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place.<br>
<br>
9:13 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people.<br>
<br>
9:14 For they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.<br>
<br>
9:15 And they did so, and made them all sit down.<br>
<br>
9:16 And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.<br>
<br>
9:17 And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.<br>
<br>
9:18 And it came to pass, as he was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am?<br>
<br>
9:19 And they answering said, John the Baptist; but others `say', Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.<br>
<br>
9:20 And he said unto them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.<br>
<br>
9:21 But he charged them, and commanded `them' to tell this to no man;<br>
<br>
9:22 saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.<br>
<br>
9:23 And he said unto all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.<br>
<br>
9:24 For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.<br>
<br>
9:25 For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?<br>
<br>
9:26 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and `the glory' of the Father, and of the holy angels.<br>
<br>
9:27 But I tell you of a truth, There are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
9:28 And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.<br>
<br>
9:29 And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment `became' white `and' dazzling.<br>
<br>
9:30 And behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah;<br>
<br>
9:31 who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
9:32 Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.<br>
<br>
9:33 And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.<br>
<br>
9:34 And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.<br>
<br>
9:35 And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear ye him.<br>
<br>
9:36 And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.<br>
<br>
9:37 And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.<br>
<br>
9:38 And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child:<br>
<br>
9:39 and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely.<br>
<br>
9:40 And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not.<br>
<br>
9:41 And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son.<br>
<br>
9:42 And as he was yet a coming, the demon dashed him down, and tare `him' grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.<br>
<br>
9:43 And they were all astonished at the majesty of God. But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples,<br>
<br>
9:44 Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.<br>
<br>
9:45 But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.<br>
<br>
9:46 And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest.<br>
<br>
9:47 But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side,<br>
<br>
9:48 and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.<br>
<br>
9:49 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.<br>
<br>
9:50 But Jesus said unto him, Forbid `him' not: for he that is not against you is for you.<br>
<br>
9:51 And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,<br>
<br>
9:52 and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.<br>
<br>
9:53 And they did not receive him, because his face was `as though he were' going to Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
9:54 And when his disciples James and John saw `this', they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them?<br>
<br>
9:55 But he turned, and rebuked them.<br>
<br>
9:56 And they went to another village.<br>
<br>
9:57 And as they went on the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.<br>
<br>
9:58 And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven `have' nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.<br>
<br>
9:59 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.<br>
<br>
9:60 But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of God.<br>
<br>
9:61 And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house.<br>
<br>
9:62 But Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.<br>
