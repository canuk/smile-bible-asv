<blockquote>
7:1 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.<br>
<br>
7:2 But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.<br>
<br>
7:3 Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.<br>
<br>
7:4 The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.<br>
<br>
7:5 Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.<br>
<br>
7:6 But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.<br>
<br>
7:7 Yet I would that all men were even as I myself. Howbeit each man hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that.<br>
<br>
7:8 But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.<br>
<br>
7:9 But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.<br>
<br>
7:10 But unto the married I give charge, `yea' not I, but the Lord, That the wife depart not from her husband<br>
<br>
7:11 (but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife.<br>
<br>
7:12 But to the rest say I, not the Lord: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her.<br>
<br>
7:13 And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.<br>
<br>
7:14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.<br>
<br>
7:15 Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such `cases': but God hath called us in peace.<br>
<br>
7:16 For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? Or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife?<br>
<br>
7:17 Only, as the Lord hath distributed to each man, as God hath called each, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all the churches.<br>
<br>
7:18 Was any man called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Hath any been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.<br>
<br>
7:19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of God.<br>
<br>
7:20 Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called.<br>
<br>
7:21 Wast thou called being a bondservant? Care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use `it' rather.<br>
<br>
7:22 For he that was called in the Lord being a bondservant, is the Lord's freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is Christ's bondservant.<br>
<br>
7:23 Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men.<br>
<br>
7:24 Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with God.<br>
<br>
7:25 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be trustworthy.<br>
<br>
7:26 I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, `namely,' that it is good for a man to be as he is.<br>
<br>
7:27 Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.<br>
<br>
7:28 But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you.<br>
<br>
7:29 But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none;<br>
<br>
7:30 and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;<br>
<br>
7:31 and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away.<br>
<br>
7:32 But I would have you to be free from cares. He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord:<br>
<br>
7:33 but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife,<br>
<br>
7:34 and is divided. `So' also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.<br>
<br>
7:35 And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.<br>
<br>
7:36 But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin `daughter', if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.<br>
<br>
7:37 But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching in his own heart, to keep his own virgin `daughter', shall do well.<br>
<br>
7:38 So then both he that giveth his own virgin `daughter' in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.<br>
<br>
7:39 A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.<br>
<br>
7:40 But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of God.<br>
