<blockquote>
28:1 And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.<br>
<br>
28:2 And the barbarians showed us no common kindness; for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.<br>
<br>
28:3 But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.<br>
<br>
28:4 And when the barbarians saw the `venomous' creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live.<br>
<br>
28:5 Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.<br>
<br>
28:6 But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.<br>
<br>
28:7 Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.<br>
<br>
28:8 And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.<br>
<br>
28:9 And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:<br>
<br>
28:10 who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.<br>
<br>
28:11 And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.<br>
<br>
28:12 And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.<br>
<br>
28:13 And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli;<br>
<br>
28:14 where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.<br>
<br>
28:15 And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.<br>
<br>
28:16 And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.<br>
<br>
28:17 And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:<br>
<br>
28:18 who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.<br>
<br>
28:19 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation.<br>
<br>
28:20 For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with `me': for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.<br>
<br>
28:21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.<br>
<br>
28:22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.<br>
<br>
28:23 And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded `the matter,' testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.<br>
<br>
28:24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.<br>
<br>
28:25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers,<br>
<br>
28:26 saying, Go thou unto this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:<br>
<br>
28:27 For this people's heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest, haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.<br>
<br>
28:28 Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear.<br>
<br>
28:29 `And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves.'<br>
<br>
28:30 And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him,<br>
<br>
28:31 preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him.<br>
