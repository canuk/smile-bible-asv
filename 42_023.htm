<blockquote>
23:1 And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate.<br>
<br>
23:2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ a king.<br>
<br>
23:3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest.<br>
<br>
23:4 And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.<br>
<br>
23:5 But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place.<br>
<br>
23:6 But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.<br>
<br>
23:7 And when he knew that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.<br>
<br>
23:8 Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.<br>
<br>
23:9 And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.<br>
<br>
23:10 And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.<br>
<br>
23:11 And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate.<br>
<br>
23:12 And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.<br>
<br>
23:13 And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,<br>
<br>
23:14 and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:<br>
<br>
23:15 no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him.<br>
<br>
23:16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.<br>
<br>
23:17 `Now he must needs release unto them at the feast one prisoner.'<br>
<br>
23:18 But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: --<br>
<br>
23:19 one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.<br>
<br>
23:20 And Pilate spake unto them again, desiring to release Jesus;<br>
<br>
23:21 but they shouted, saying, Crucify, crucify him.<br>
<br>
23:22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him.<br>
<br>
23:23 But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed.<br>
<br>
23:24 And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.<br>
<br>
23:25 And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.<br>
<br>
23:26 And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to bear it after Jesus.<br>
<br>
23:27 And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.<br>
<br>
23:28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.<br>
<br>
23:29 For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.<br>
<br>
23:30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.<br>
<br>
23:31 For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?<br>
<br>
23:32 And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.<br>
<br>
23:33 And when they came unto the place which is called The skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left.<br>
<br>
23:34 And Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And parting his garments among them, they cast lots.<br>
<br>
23:35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen.<br>
<br>
23:36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar,<br>
<br>
23:37 and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.<br>
<br>
23:38 And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br>
<br>
23:39 And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.<br>
<br>
23:40 But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?<br>
<br>
23:41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.<br>
<br>
23:42 And he said, Jesus, remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.<br>
<br>
23:43 And he said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.<br>
<br>
23:44 And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour,<br>
<br>
23:45 the sun's light failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.<br>
<br>
23:46 And Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost.<br>
<br>
23:47 And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.<br>
<br>
23:48 And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts.<br>
<br>
23:49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.<br>
<br>
23:50 And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good and righteous man<br>
<br>
23:51 (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), `a man' of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God:<br>
<br>
23:52 this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.<br>
<br>
23:53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had yet lain.<br>
<br>
23:54 And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.<br>
<br>
23:55 And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.<br>
<br>
23:56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.<br>
