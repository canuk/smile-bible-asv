<blockquote>
18:1 And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;<br>
<br>
18:2 and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,<br>
<br>
18:3 and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:<br>
<br>
18:4 let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:<br>
<br>
18:5 and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.<br>
<br>
18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.<br>
<br>
18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it.<br>
<br>
18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.<br>
<br>
18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.<br>
<br>
18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.<br>
<br>
18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, `and' well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.<br>
<br>
18:12 And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?<br>
<br>
18:13 And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?<br>
<br>
18:14 Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.<br>
<br>
18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.<br>
<br>
18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.<br>
<br>
18:17 And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;<br>
<br>
18:18 seeing that Abraham had surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?<br>
<br>
18:19 For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.<br>
<br>
18:20 And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;<br>
<br>
18:21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.<br>
<br>
18:22 And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah.<br>
<br>
18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?<br>
<br>
18:24 Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?<br>
<br>
18:25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?<br>
<br>
18:26 And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.<br>
<br>
18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:<br>
<br>
18:28 peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.<br>
<br>
18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty's sake.<br>
<br>
18:30 And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.<br>
<br>
18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty's sake.<br>
<br>
18:32 And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.<br>
<br>
18:33 And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.<br>
