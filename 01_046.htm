<blockquote>
46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to Beer-sheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.<br>
<br>
46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.<br>
<br>
46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:<br>
<br>
46:4 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.<br>
<br>
46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beer-sheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.<br>
<br>
46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him:<br>
<br>
46:7 his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons's daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.<br>
<br>
46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's first-born.<br>
<br>
46:9 And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.<br>
<br>
46:10 And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.<br>
<br>
46:11 And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.<br>
<br>
46:12 And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.<br>
<br>
46:13 And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron.<br>
<br>
46:14 And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.<br>
<br>
46:15 These are the sons of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three.<br>
<br>
46:16 And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.<br>
<br>
46:17 And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Heber, and Malchiel.<br>
<br>
46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter; and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.<br>
<br>
46:19 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.<br>
<br>
46:20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Poti-phera priest of On, bare unto him.<br>
<br>
46:21 And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.<br>
<br>
46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen.<br>
<br>
46:23 And the sons of Dan: Hushim.<br>
<br>
46:24 And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.<br>
<br>
46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.<br>
<br>
46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six;<br>
<br>
46:27 and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were threescore and ten.<br>
<br>
46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to show the way before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.<br>
<br>
46:29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he presented himself unto him, and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.<br>
<br>
46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, that thou art yet alive.<br>
<br>
46:31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;<br>
<br>
46:32 and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.<br>
<br>
46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation?<br>
<br>
46:34 that ye shall say, Thy servants have been keepers of cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.<br>
