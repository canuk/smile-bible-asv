<blockquote>
11:1 And when they draw nigh unto Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples,<br>
<br>
11:2 and saith unto them, Go your way into the village that is over against you: and straightway as ye enter into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon no man ever yet sat; loose him, and bring him.<br>
<br>
11:3 And if any one say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him back hither.<br>
<br>
11:4 And they went away, and found a colt tied at the door without in the open street; and they loose him.<br>
<br>
11:5 And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?<br>
<br>
11:6 And they said unto them even as Jesus had said: and they let them go.<br>
<br>
11:7 And they bring the colt unto Jesus, and cast on him their garments; and he sat upon him.<br>
<br>
11:8 And many spread their garments upon the way; and others branches, which they had cut from the fields.<br>
<br>
11:9 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, Hosanna; Blessed `is' he that cometh in the name of the Lord:<br>
<br>
11:10 Blessed `is' the kingdom that cometh, `the kingdom' of our father David: Hosanna in the highest.<br>
<br>
11:11 And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple; and when he had looked round about upon all things, it being now eventide, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.<br>
<br>
11:12 And on the morrow, when they were come out from Bethany, he hungered.<br>
<br>
11:13 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find anything thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for it was not the season of figs.<br>
<br>
11:14 And he answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit from thee henceforward for ever. And his disciples heard it.<br>
<br>
11:15 And they come to Jerusalem: and he entered into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and them that bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves;<br>
<br>
11:16 and he would not suffer that any man should carry a vessel through the temple.<br>
<br>
11:17 And he taught, and said unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but ye have made it a den of robbers.<br>
<br>
11:18 And the chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the multitude was astonished at his teaching.<br>
<br>
11:19 And every evening he went forth out of the city.<br>
<br>
11:20 And as they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.<br>
<br>
11:21 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.<br>
<br>
11:22 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.<br>
<br>
11:23 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that what he saith cometh to pass; he shall have it.<br>
<br>
11:24 Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye pray and ask for, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.<br>
<br>
11:25 And whensoever ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any one; that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.<br>
<br>
11:26 `But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.'<br>
<br>
11:27 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;<br>
<br>
11:28 and they said unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? or who gave thee this authority to do these things?<br>
<br>
11:29 And Jesus said unto them, I will ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.<br>
<br>
11:30 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.<br>
<br>
11:31 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; He will say, Why then did ye not believe him?<br>
<br>
11:32 But should we say, From men--they feared the people: for all verily held John to be a prophet.<br>
<br>
11:33 And they answered Jesus and say, We know not. And Jesus saith unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.<br>
