<blockquote>
44:1 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.<br>
<br>
44:2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his grain money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.<br>
<br>
44:3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.<br>
<br>
44:4 `And' when they were gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?<br>
<br>
44:5 Is not this that in which my lord drinketh, and whereby he indeed divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.<br>
<br>
44:6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.<br>
<br>
44:7 And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord such words as these? Far be it from thy servants that they should do such a thing.<br>
<br>
44:8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?<br>
<br>
44:9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.<br>
<br>
44:10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my bondman; and ye shall be blameless.<br>
<br>
44:11 Then they hasted, and took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.<br>
<br>
44:12 And he searched, `and' began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.<br>
<br>
44:13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.<br>
<br>
44:14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; and he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.<br>
<br>
44:15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can indeed divine?<br>
<br>
44:16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's bondmen, both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found.<br>
<br>
44:17 And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my bondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.<br>
<br>
44:18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh, my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.<br>
<br>
44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?<br>
<br>
44:20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loveth him.<br>
<br>
44:21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.<br>
<br>
44:22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.<br>
<br>
44:23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.<br>
<br>
44:24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.<br>
<br>
44:25 And our father said, Go again, buy us a little food.<br>
<br>
44:26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, expect our youngest brother be with us.<br>
<br>
44:27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:<br>
<br>
44:28 and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:<br>
<br>
44:29 and if ye take this one also from me, and harm befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.<br>
<br>
44:30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;<br>
<br>
44:31 it will come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not `with us', that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to Sheol.<br>
<br>
44:32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father for ever.<br>
<br>
44:33 Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.<br>
<br>
44:34 For how shall I go up to my father, if the lad be not with me? lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.<br>
